brown issued an executive order eo b- directing the department of water resources dwr to update the state model water efficient landscape ordinance mwelo through expedited regulation the california water commission approved the revised mwelo on july the background summarizes the mwelo local agencies cities and counties have until december to adopt the mwelo or adopt their own ordinance which must be at least as effective in conserving water as the mwelo if local agencies do not take action by december the mwelo becomes effective by default the city water efficient landscape requirements chapter of the sacramento city code applies primarily to new landscapes in development projects the water efficient landscape requirements were added to the city code in in response to the water conservation in landscaping act california government code sections et seq and were later updated in to comply with state-mandated update dwr is now requiring another update the draft ordinance attachment is essentially reformatted version of the mwelo the most significant change in this recent update is that it will lower the size threshold for landscapes associated with new development projects that are subject to the ordinance the previous size threshold ranged from square feet to square feet the new threshold will include landscape areas as small as square feet this will require nearly every residential commercial industrial and institutional new development project that requires permit plan check or design review to undergo comprehensive review of landscape plans at the time of building permit plan check another significant change is that the update adds an annual reporting requirement for the city the first of which is due december this update will also incorporate the following required changes to regulations for new and rehabilitated landscapes  reduce water budget allowance for landscapes  increase requirements for more efficient irrigation systems  prohibit high water use plants such as cool season turf in median strips  improve measures for onsite stormwater capture such as improving soil friability  provide incentives for graywater usage and  create new prescriptive measures compliance option for landscapes under square feet policy considerations the general plan includes the following policy related to water efficient landscapes in new development  landscaping the city shall continue to require the use of water-efficient and river friendly landscaping in all new development and shall use water conservation gardens of glen ellen water conservation office to demonstrate and promote water conserving landscapes economic impacts none environmental considerations the proposed ordinance is not subject to the provisions of the california environmental quality act ceqa consistent with section of the ceqa guidelines under this section where it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have significant effect on the environment the activity is not subject to ceqa sustainability the proposed ordinance is consistent with the city sustainability goals because it will reduce water use in new residential landscapes by and new commercial landscapes by and will increase onsite storm-water capture commission committee action on the law and legislation committee passed motion approving and forwarding to city council an ordinance repealing and adding chapter of the sacramento city code relating to water efficient landscape requirements rationale for recommendation

city existing water conservation and sustainability policies financial considerations not applicable local business enterprise lbe not applicable of governor brown drought executive order of april eo b- directed dwr to update the state model water efficient landscape ordinance ordinance through expedited regulation the california water commission approved the revised ordinance on july which projects are subject to the ordinance new development projects that include landscape areas of sq ft or more are subject to the ordinance this applies to residential commercial industrial and institutional projects that require permit plan check or design review the previous landscape size threshold for new development projects ranged from sq ft to sq ft the size threshold for existing landscapes that are being rehabilitated has not changed remaining at sq ft only rehabilitated landscapes that are associated with building or landscape permit plan check or design review are subject to the ordinance when does the ordinance go into effect local agencies cities and counties have until december to adopt the ordinance or adopt their own ordinance which must be at least as effective in conserving water as the state ordinance local agencies working together to develop regional ordinance have until february to adopt but they are still subject to the december reporting requirements see reporting requirements below if local agency does not take action on water efficient landscape ordinance by the specified dates the state ordinance becomes effective by default what are the significant revisions more efficient irrigation systems dedicated landscape water meters or submeters are required for residential landscapes over sq ft and non-residential landscapes over sq ft irrigation systems are required to have pressure regulators and master shut-off valves all irrigation emission devices must meet the national standard stated in the ordinance to ensure that only high efficiency sprinklers are installed flow sensors that detect and report high flow conditions due to broken pipes and or popped sprinkler heads are required for landscape areas greater than sq ft the minimum width of areas that can be overhead irrigated was changed from feet to feet areas less than feet wide must be irrigated with subsurface drip or other technology that produces no over spray or runoff incentives for graywater usage landscapes under sq ft that are irrigated entirely with graywater or captured rainwater are subject only to the irrigation system requirements of appendix prescriptive compliance option updated of improvements in onsite stormwater capture friable soil is required in planted areas to maximize water retention and infiltration four yards of compost per sq ft of area must be incorporated other recommended measures for increasing onsite stormwater retention are listed in the ordinance limiting the portion of landscapes that can be planted with high water use plants the maximum amount of water that can be applied to landscape is reduced from of the reference evapotranspiration eto to for residential landscape projects and to of eto for non-residential projects this water allowance reduces the landscape area that can be planted with high water use plants such as cool season turf for residential projects the coverage of high water use plants is reduced from to of the landscaped area in non residential landscapes planting with high water use plants is not feasible however unchanged in the ordinance is the extra water allowance made for non-residential areas when used for specific functional areas such as recreation and edible gardens extra water allowance is also made for landscapes irrigated with recycled water as was the case in the previous ordinance the irrigation efficiency of devices used to irrigate landscapes is one of the factors that goes into determining the maximum amount of water allowed rather than having one default irrigation efficiency for the entire site the revised ordinance allows the irrigation efficiency to be entered for each area of the landscape the site-wide irrigation efficiency of the previous ordinance was the revised ordinance defines the irrigation efficiency of drip as and that of overhead spray as median strips cannot be landscaped with high water use plants precluding the use of cool season turf also because of the requirement to irrigate areas less than ten feet wide with subsurface irrigation or other means that produces no runoff or overspray the use of cool season turf in parkways is limited reporting requirements all local agencies will report on the implementation and enforcement of their ordinances to dwr by december local agencies developing regional ordinance will report on their adopted regional ordinance by march reporting for all agencies will be due by january 31st of each year thereafter prescriptive checklist option for landscapes under sq ft projects with landscape areas under sq feet may comply with the performance requirements of the ordinance or conform to the prescriptive measures contained in appendix many will find that the appendix checklist simplifies compliance how much water will be saved dwr estimates that typical california landscape will use gallons less year or percent less than allowed by the ordinance commercial landscapes will cut water use by over the next three years it is predicted that new homes associated with acres of landscape will be built in california with proper implementation and enforcement by local agencies the ordinance will lead to substantial water savings how can get additional assistance in fall dwr will release guidance document to accompany the ordinance training workshops for local agency staff and landscape professionals will be held throughout the state contact information julie saare-edmonds dwr senior environmental scientist at julie saare-edmonds water ca gov or updated of

ordinance local agencies consistent with the department regulations and the water conservation in landscaping act california government code sections et seq must by december adopt the model ordinance as set forth in chapter of division of title of the california code of regulations or water efficient landscape ordinance that is based on evidence in the record at least as effective in conserving water as the model ordinance the legislature in the water conservation in landscaping act has made the following findings the waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands the continuation of california economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource page of of landscapes are essential to the quality of life in california by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water preventing erosion offering fire protection and replacing ecosystems lost to development landscape design installation maintenance and management can and should be water efficient and section of article of the california constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use consistent with these legislative findings the purpose of this chapter is to comply with the water conservation in landscaping act by adopting an ordinance based on the provisions of the updated model water efficient landscape ordinance issued by the california department of water resources that promotes the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water establishes structure for planning designing installing maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated landscape projects establishes provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention

preservation policy city of aurora policy on preservation of existing trees policy this document represents the policy of the city of aurora that existing trees within the city which are alive and in good health shall remain in their present location and shall be safeguarded from damage that may result from the development process therefore existing healthy trees with caliper greater than or equal to inches as measured four and one-half feet above the ground shall be preserved or protected during the development process this policy shall be incorporated into the planning department landscape review procedures for site plan approval in addition this policy shall also be applied to properties or sites not required to provide site plan scope this policy shall apply to all residential and non-residential development projects within the city of aurora including city projects on city-owned or managed properties exempted from this policy are single-family detached residential properties where additions or modifications to existing buildings or improvements to the lot are proposed definitions for the purposes of implementing this policy the following terms are hereby defined  development process the intent to construct upon improve or modify any property within the city of aurora whether governed by site plan or not  intent having the mind attention or will to develop modify construct or improve real property within the city of aurora  mitigation the replacement of trees removed from site due to the development process replacement may include relocation of existing trees the planting of caliper inches lost or cash payments to the tree planting fund  preservation the act of keeping existing trees safe from injury harm or destruction during the development process  relocation the practice of moving an existing tree to another site or other location within the same site  tree protection zone generally an area encompassing one linear foot in radius around the tree per inch of trunk diameter for example tree inches in diameter measured at feet from the ground should have disturbance free zone with -foot radius around the tree as measured from the tree trunk properties affected properties governed by site plan applicability generally includes residential and non-residential properties within the city of aurora except as noted in section subsection properties not included in this policy requirements properties in this category must comply with the following items preservation site designers shall make all feasible attempts to accommodate existing trees within their design relocation if tree relocation within the site is attempted it shall be performed by professional forester or nurseryman all available measures shall be taken to ensure the life and good health of the tree mitigation tree mitigation plan shall be specified mitigation plans shall consist of an equal replacement of tree caliper inches lost on site these plans shall indicate the trees that are proposed to comply with mitigation requirements including the location of replacement trees and the location of trees that are proposed for relocation no tree for mitigation shall be less than two inches in caliper and shall be of no less quality species than the tree removed as determined by the tree appraisal guidelines published by the international society of arboriculture isa as amended for example two ten-inch caliper trees are removed because of site constraints the caliper inches lost equals inches these inches can be replaced by planting five four-inch caliper trees or four five-inch caliper trees if the trees removed are blue spruce they could not be replaced with an upright juniper or other tree species that is considered of lesser quality by the isa guidelines should on-site tree replacement and or relocation not be possible tree replacement and or relocation shall take place through any or all of the following methods replacement of equal caliper lost on another site replacement of equal caliper lost on public lands relocation of trees to public lands payment of value of caliper lost to the tree planting fund mitigation shall be in addition to standard landscape requirements established by the planning department trees planted to comply with standard landscape requirements may not be counted as satisfying tree mitigation requirements in the case of tree removals the location species and caliper of trees to be removed and their replacements shall be included on the landscape site plan in the case of tree relocations on site the placement of the relocated trees shall be included on the landscape site plan properties not governed by site plan applicability generally includes properties that were developed before existing site plan requirements were in place or were not required to provide site plan examples of this type of property include non-residential properties that were developed before existing site plan requirements single-family detached residential infill or single-family detached lot division projects multi-family and single-family attached residential properties requirements properties in this category shall comply with the same rules and guidelines set forth for properties governed by site plan projects on city property healthy trees within city-owned properties city-owned or designated street rights of-way city-managed properties and easements or city-managed projects shall not be removed or damaged during construction or development projects except as last alternative or to preserve public health and safety future planning or alteration of existing city properties projects or rights-of way shall make provisions for the preservation of existing trees if preserving existing trees is not feasible city departments shall follow the same rules and guidelines set forth in section subsection of this policy properties not included in this policy single family or two family developed residential properties procedures protection of existing trees during the construction process site construction shall take into account the life and good health of trees preserved on the site the following guidelines shall be followed for tree protection if these guidelines are not followed the full value of the tree will be used in calculations to determine mitigation requirements protective fencing shall be set up to visibly show the tree protection zone all equipment including foot traffic shall remain outside of the tree protection zone if roots greater than -inch in diameter require removal clean cut shall be accomplished using sharp hand tool maximum of two -inch diameter roots per tree are permitted for removal the removal of additional roots -inches or greater in diameter requires approval of the city forester or designee limb removal shall be accomplished before construction begins professional company that is licensed by the city of aurora forestry division shall complete all pruning designate concrete washout areas these areas shall not flow into or across the tree protection zone no stockpiling of soil is permitted within the tree protection zone no vehicle parking is permitted within the tree protection zone the soil shall not be compacted within the tree protection zone existing trees damaged through the construction process shall be immediately repaired and if damaged beyond repair replaced per the mitigation specifications outlined in section subsection item the restoration plan for these trees shall follow that approved through the site plan submittal interruption and maintenance of drainageways drainage plans for individual sites shall not alter the supply of water to existing stands of trees if the longevity of those trees is dependent upon the flows if the drainage of the site requires altering the existing supply of water some alternative form through the use of irrigation shall be available from the time the existing watering source is eliminated this policy shall not preclude standard maintenance of drainageways necessary to ensure the free flow of storm water it will however protect those trees that do not interfere with the flow of storm drainage drainageways shall be maintained at the density of trees for which they were designed and future drainageways shall be designed as far as economically feasible to consider preservation of mature stands of trees if preservation is not possible mitigation and or replacement shall be accomplished as outlined in section subsection item timing for tree mitigation activities tree preservation and or mitigation may be accomplished at any time during the development process the timing of these activities is especially critical when moving trees from one location to another the city forester or designee shall determine the conditions that will ensure the optimal success for tree relocation preservation or mitigation when feasible the decision to relocate trees will be made after all planning process requirements are completed in cases where conditions necessitate the relocation of trees before all planning processes are

township for its contribution to our efforts springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission zoning part zoning procedures what is zoning zoning generally provides for the regulation of two things land use and aspects of property and its structures permitted land use is generally described by zoning classification often referred to as the zoning district property in unincorporated sangamon county is currently classified into zoning districts agricultural single-family residential r- and r-1a single-family and two family residential r- general residences r- manufactured homes rm- office and college neighborhood business b- retail business b- general business b- restricted industrial i- and general industrial i- each of these districts may have different regulations as well as different permitted uses and conditional permitted uses permitted use allows for the use in the district at-will that is with no additional zoning review and ap proval for example in the r- and r-1a district single family residence is permitted use so such use would be allowed in any r- and r-1a district without further zoning review on the other hand conditional permitted use most often referred to as cpu addresses uses that are potentially incom patible with the area but could still be allowed with approval of the county board following review and demonstration that the use meets certain conditions described in ordinance for example in the r- and r-1a district group care facility is allowed only as cpu regulations concerning aspects of the property or its structures deal with such matters as the size or con figuration of lot where parking may be located how far structure must be set-back from property line or the bulk and size of structures to be located on property these regulations also deal with such specifics as location of accessory structures fences walls and hedges swimming pools satellite dishes landscaping and lighting and signage the complexity of these regulations and which ones apply can change by zoning district these purposes and aspects addressed by the zoning ordinance are important because they address matters affecting public health safety and welfare and because they allow for consistency of application of the regulations across properties having the same zoning appropriate zoning is required prior to any development plan approval so this guidebook begins with consideration of the county zoning process and regulations when is the zoning process required changes in zoning are most often required when change in use is contemplated for example when land currently zoned for agri cultural use is to be converted to residential or some other use or the property owner is interested in change in specific compati bility or area requirement such as yard dimension building height signage or lot configuration that is not allowed under the property existing zoning classification changes in zoning which may involve rezoning request for conditional permitted use or variance of the zoning regulations involve petition process through the petition process application is made for the zoning change to be considered if change in use from an agricultural to non-agricultural use is requested the land evaluation and site assessment lesa scoring system may also be required lesa is discussed on page springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission rezoning requests zoning what matters are considered in the the county rezoning zoning process process typically six matters are considered amendments to the zoning ordinance itself most often called text pre-application meeting amendments which change the code the rezoning optional of property from one zoning district to another often called map amendment which establishes the zoning for parcel or parcels requests for conditional per submission of petition for zoning mitted uses which expand upon permitted uses in zon change ing district requests for special uses in zoning dis trict that would otherwise not allow the requested use requests that sections of the ordinance be varied for review public notice by zoning particular parcel or parcels because of special conditions department related to the site and the proposed use and appeals of the zoning administrator interpretation of the zoning code review and staff recommendation by regional what is the process the petition will planning commission follow the zoning petition process is generally described in the hearing review and recommen diagram to the right following submission of valid peti dation of zoning board of appeals tion for zoning relief the zoning department staff pro vides review and arranges for public notice and posting the zoning request is posted in the newspaper as well as on signs placed on the subject property or properties recommend recommend the petition is then provided to the sscrpc staff who approval denial review the request and provide professional staff opin as submitted ion to the sangamon county zoning board of appeals or amended zba as to whether or not the request should be ap proved denied or approved with conditions the zba then considers the request following public consideration action by hearing before that body both those offering evidence in county board support of the relief as well as those opposing it are heard at this public hearing the zba does not make final determination in zoning approval denial case but instead refers its findings and recommenda as submitted tions to the sangamon county board the county board or amended makes the final determination as to whether or not zoning relief should be granted and the extent to which relief is provided certificate of compliance springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission zoning rezoning requests continued the rezoning who reviews rezoning request process ultimately four groups review every rezoning request at vari ous stages of the process the zoning administrator za is responsible for examining and ap proving applications that conform with the ordinance and conducts ex pre-application meeting aminations related to the requirements the za determines lot bulk and optional parking requirements in certain instances conducts inspections to deter mine compliance with the ordinance helps ensure that petitions for re zoning are properly posted so that they may be placed on the zoning board of appeals agenda for public hearing and determination and may submission of petition for zoning be called upon to provide administrative interpretations of the ordinance change and its requirements the za also assists the county board by providing it with the zba rec ommendation and findings of fact in each zoning case review public notice by zoning department the springfield-sangamon county regional planning commis sion sscrpc must provide the zoning board of appeals with written report on all proposed zoning amendments map as well as text cpu requests and variances review and staff recommendation by regional the sscrpc bases its assessment upon the evidence provided in the planning commission petition review of trends in the area in which the rezoning is re quested the comprehensive plan and an examination of the site in ques tion and the surrounding uses the sscrpc staff report will recommend that the relief requested be granted denied or amended and the basis upon which this recommen dation is made this recommendation is not binding upon the zba or public hearing review and county board as other evidence may come to light in the hearing and recommendation of zoning board review process of appeals the zoning board of appeals is primary finder of fact in the rezon ing process the zba conducts public hearing on each rezoning case recommend recommend hears the evidence in each case and submits its findings and recommen approval denial dations to the county board the zba is empowered to hear cases in as submitted or volving proposed zoning text and map amendments cpus variances and amended challenges to the zoning administrator interpretation of the zoning code consideration action by it is the zba recommendation and report of findings of fact that goes to county board the county board the sangamon county board provides the final determination in each approval denial case it hears the report and recommendations of the zba conducts an as submitted or additional public hearing on the case where both proponents and oppo amended nents of the petition may be heard and za and sscrpc staff questioned and then may act to approve deny or amend the requested relief certificate of in most cases action by the county board only requires simple majority compliance vote but this is not true in all cases these cases will be addressed bit later in this guide springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission rezoning requests continued zoning who can initiate rezoning request all properties have underlying zoning but sometimes property owner seeks change in use requir ing rezoning petition for rezoning may be filed by an interested property owner contract pur chaser county board member or the executive director of the springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission in cases where the petitioner is contract purchaser the contract purchaser must provide letter from the owner stating that the owner is aware of the petition and what it requests that the petitioner is in deed contract purchaser and that the owner approves of the action what are the procedures for requesting rezoning petitions for rezoning must be filed with the zoning administrator in writing and contain the informa tion required by ordinance or county zoning board of appeals zba rule it must be filed at least days prior to the date of hearing by the zba what are the application requirements along with the specifics of the relief requested the petition must include list of all adjacent property owners including owners across the street or alley as well as their mailing addresses it must also in clude map which shows the boundaries of the property the location of existing and or proposed struc tures in relation to lot lines and adjacent land uses if cpu or variance is requested it should also pro vide information showing that it meets the conditions required for this relief springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission zoning conditional permitted use cpu requests what is cpu conditional permitted use or cpu provides for the location of special classes of uses which are desir able for the public welfare within given zoning district or districts but that may be incompatible with the typical uses allowed in the district or districts allowing for cpus recognizes that there are special uses of land which because of their unique character cannot be properly classified in any particular zoning district or districts without additional consideration in each case on the impact that the use might have on neighboring land the public need for the particular use or the particular location in the sangamon county zoning ordinance cpus fall into two categories  uses operated by public agency or public-regulated utilities or uses traditionally affected with pub lic interest  uses entirely private in character but of such nature that the operation may give rise to unique prob lems with respect to their impact on neighboring property or public facilities for example an electric substation is not permitted use in the single-family residence district but may be allowed with approval of cpu similarly while unlighted golf courses are permitted use in the sin gle-family residence district lighted golf courses and driving ranges are allowed only as cpu these two uses requiring cpus are indicative of class of uses that may be allowed in the zoning district but are seen as requiring additional consideration as to the impact they might have on neighboring properties the public need for the use and the particular circumstances of the proposed location what are the standards for granting cpu since the uses included under cpu presume that special conditions for their granting are required the sangamon county zoning ordinance establishes standards that must all be met for cpu to be granted by the county board three general standards for cpu are found in section of the zoning code no cpu shall be granted unless it  is so proposed that the proposed location design and method of such use will minimize the adjacent effects on the character of the surrounding area and  is so proposed to be operated designed and located so that the public health safety and welfare will be protected and  will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the vicinity in which it is located in addition to these general standards for all cpus additional standards are also established for such spe cial uses as fairgrounds public or private outdoor recreation centers manufactured home parks tourist homes motels and hotels taverns and liquor stores and wind energy conversion systems wind farms who can initiate cpu request and what are the procedures since cpu is rezoning it is subject to the same requirements and procedures as any other zoning request can cpus be subject to additional restrictions yes the zba may recommend and the county board may provide restrictions upon the location con struction and operation of cpu including but not limited to off-street parking and loading as may be deemed necessary to provide for the general objectives of the ordinance and to minimize injury to the value of property in the vicinity springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission zoning variation requests zoning what is variance as the name implies variation or variance is granting of permission to depart from the literal en forcement of the zoning code upon finding that there are practical difficulties or particular hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations provided by the ordinance variance varies the law for particular property granting an exception to the strict requirements of the code not available more generally what types of variations are allowed primarily variations can be considered for areas which typically includes varying such things as bulk setback lot configuration parking and other such requirements and for uses the zba may only con sider use variance after it has found that rezoning of the property based on the required findings of fact would not serve the public interest and would not be appropriate who can initiate variance request as variance is zoning matter the same parties may submit variance request as any other rezoning an interested property owner or contract purchaser or their agent what are the procedures for requesting variance as with other zoning relief the process begins with petition for variation being filed with the sangamon county dept of zoning from that point on the request for variance is handled as any other zoning re quest except petition for use variance may be filed only if petition for an amendment to the zoning map is recommended for denial by the zoning board of appeals or petition for an amend ment is denied by the county board and the appropriate fee accompanies the petition what this ef fectively means is that petitioner must first request rezoning of the property to the appropriate zoning classification and be denied before use variance can be requested therefore the approval of use variance typically requires that the petitioner go through the process twice once requesting zoning change to the correct classification for the use and then again requesting use variance should the peti tion for the classification change be denied denial of requested zoning classification change should not however be taken as an indication that use variance will subsequently be granted if however the sscrpc finds during its staff review that reclassification should not be granted but further recommends that use variance is appropriate as the situation meets the conditions for variation the zba may consider that in its deliberations and recommend the use variance to the county board with out the petitioner being required to resubmit an additional petition for the use variance what are the conditions for granting variance as with cpu the zoning ordinance establishes standards that must be considered for granting vari ance the standards are different for area and use variances all of the conditions are to be met to grant variance the standards to be considered for an area variance are  that the property in question cannot be economically used or cannot yield reasonable return if per mitted to be used only for the conditions allowed by the regulations and  that the plight of the owner is due to circumstances unique to the property and not generally applica ble to other property in the area and  that the variation if granted will not alter the essential character of the locality impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property increase the congestion of traffic or diminish or impair property values in the locality springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission zoning zoning variation requests continued the standards to be considered for use variance request are that the variance  is justified by showing of special circumstances demonstrating practical difficulties or particular hard ship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the zoning regulations and  is compatible with the trend in the area and  will benefit the community and be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning regu lations and  will not create negative impact on the area will not alter the essential character of the locality im pair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property increase the congestion of traffic or minish or impair property values in the locality again those considering an area or use variance should note that the ordinance indicates that all of the standards for variation be met before variance can be granted when petitioning for an area or use vari ance the petitioner should provide evidence that the variance if granted would meet all of the standards required is there anything else that must be considered for variance yes since variance offers special exception for particular property owner that is not available gen erally the zoning ordinance provides additional guidance to help the zoning board of appeals in making its recommendation it says that in making decision and arriving at its findings concerning variance the zoning board of appeals must take into account eight factors variations should not be used to make major changes in the permitted uses in zoning district if use is not permitted in the zoning district for the property variation for an unpermitted use should be the exception for such variation will permit use that will be incompatible with the legitimate uses in the district and may create bad precedent variations should not impact upon the character of the surrounding neighborhood in detrimental manner variations should be evaluated by comparing the relative gain to the property that seeks the variance against the gain to the public and surrounding neighborhood if the variance is not granted variances are less likely to be justified if the hardship or practical difficulty has been created by the petitioner variances are less likely to be justified if the property has been economically and or successfully used in the past without the need for variation variation decisions should be based upon the characteristics of the property as opposed to the person who is presenting the petition variation decisions should consider previous precedents established for the neighborhood and the county variation decisions should consider whether they will create bad or good precedent for the future may the zoning board of appeals impose conditions on variance yes the zba may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefitted by the variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards noted above can variance become void yes use variance can use variance becomes void if person does not comply with the variation granted and or any of its conditions or if it is not used within one year from the date it was granted or if it ceases to be utilized for two years springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission exempt temporary uses zoning are there any uses exempt from the zoning code yes section of the code establishes number of uses that are exempted by the ordinance and allowed in any zoning district these are  agricultural uses as defined except that the location of farm buildings must conform with the front lot line lot width and front yard setback regulations established in the ordinance the definition of agri cultural uses is rather extensive and can be found in the definitions chapter of the zoning ordinance  poles wires cables conduits vaults laterals pipes mains valves temporary batch plants for use during construction only solar and wind energy systems air and noise pollution monitoring stations and electric power gas water and sewer lines provided that the installation shall conform with appli cable federal communications commission and federal aviation agency rules and regulations and other authorities having jurisdiction some of these uses may be regulated in other ways and places in code however batch plants and wind energy conversion systems wecs  telephone distribution centers exchanges and substations and electrical substations and distribution centers and gas regulator stations are exempt from the lot area and width requirements and the front yard requirement except that foot front yard must be maintained some other requirements rela tive to corner lots still apply this section also exempts some temporary uses what types of temporary uses are allowed the section noted above exempts the temporary use of land for special events but only during the dura tion of the event including but not limited to fairs rodeos firework stands and seasonal fruit and vege table stands including associated parking it is not intended however to allow the general sale of mer chandise unrelated to special event the section also identifies as temporary use land for the installation maintenance and operation of batch plants used by contractors in the ordinary course of construction activities however in the case of batch plants this temporary use may only be granted if the contractor obtains written permission from all residents within feet of the batch plant and it cannot continue past the duration of the single con tract for which the batch plant was installed and operated who can initiate temporary use request application is made like other zoning requests allowing the property owner of their agent to make the request who grants temporary use requests for temporary uses are filed with the zoning administrator the zoning administrator may is sue the temporary permit upon approval of the county board committee that oversees zoning planning and subdivisions are there conditions associated with granting temporary use there can be permits may be limited by time for example tents or other temporary structures are lim ited to the period of the event the sale of general merchandise is prohibited permits for fireworks stands are limited to days from june to july and batch plants must obtain written permission from all residents within ft of the plant and the permit may not continue past the duration of the single con tract for which the batch plant was installed and operated springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission zoning one time exception to bulk regulations in a- what is the one time exception in the agricultural district when the sangamon county zoning ordinance was revised number of years ago it established new bulk regulations which affected such things as minimum lot area and minimum lot width for the agricul tural a- zoning district the new minimum lot area was established as acres and minimum lot width was established as feet as this action reduced the flexibility of those living in the a- district to vide portions of property for other uses such as residential that had been allowed in the past the county board provided for one time exception from the minimum lot area requirements for those who owned property in the agricultural district section of the new ordinance provides this grandfathering for those in the a- district as it allows that for each acres of land owned in fee simple by single owner or joint owners as to the en tire acres in the a- district the owner or owners are entitled to convey single lot not to exceed acres from the property to grantee for the purpose of the grantee establishing dwelling the lots es tablished under the one time exception may remain zoned a- but must meet all other requirements of the zoning ordinance is it available to all property owners with agricultural zoning no it is available to owners of property of acres or more as of the date of passage of the zoning ordi nance may or their successors when can this one time exception be used and who may apply it may be applied for at any time by the property owner or owners or their executors to whom the right accrues so it may only be used once once per acres so that  acres one single one acre lot exemption is permitted  acres two single one acre lot exemptions  three single one acre lot exemptions and so forth how does someone apply for the exemption the applicant for the exemption applies to the sscrpc and pays fee the sscrpc reviews the appli cation under the provisions of the sangamon county land subdivision ordinance title sangamon county code of ordinances and with input from the county zoning administrator the exempted one acre lot or lots must comply with the provisions of that ordinance except that they are exempted from the road access fire protection district and contiguous owner requirements of the county land subdivision ordinance the sscrpc may grant the exception or exceptions without any further review or authoriza tion by the county will lesa scoring be required the land evaluation and site assessment system lesa is tool for determining the advisability of land use change from an agricultural use to non-agricultural use usually residential development and will be covered beginning on page of this guide as the one time exception in the a- district ad dresses bulk requirements rather than use lesa is not required for the simple application of the excep tion springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission voting and denial of zoning petition zoning what vote is required to approve or deny zoning relief if the written report of the zoning board of appeals recommends relief to the county board the county board may provide such relief by simple majority vote of those present and voting however if the zba recommends denial the relief may not be granted except by favorable majority vote of all members of the county board are there any other situations that would affect the number of votes required yes valid written protest can affect the voting requirement valid protest exists when the county clerk receives written protest from the owners of  of the frontage proposed to be altered or  of the frontage immediately adjoining or across an alley from the subject property or  of the frontage directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered valid written protest may also be submitted by resolution of the corporate authorities of zoned munici pality where the land affected either by map or text amendment lies within miles of the limits of the petitioning municipality in either case copy of the written protest or resolution must be served by the protestor or protestors on the applicant for the proposed amendment and copy upon the applicant attorney if any by certified mail at the address of the applicant and attorney shown in the application for the proposed amendment in order to perfect its protest the protestor or municipality must file its protest or resolution with the sanga mon county clerk and the county zoning administrator at least hours before the county board meet ing if valid written protest exists the zoning amendment may not be passed without favorable vote of of all members of the county board what happens if petition is denied the county board may act to deny zoning request the effect of denial may differ by request in the case of zoning amendment or variance request after any application for this relief has been acted upon by the county board another application requesting the same relief shall not be accepted or consid ered by the county board for period of months after that action unless the zoning board of appeals finds that the application shows that there has been substantial change in circumstances since the county board action for conditional permitted use requests section establishes month waiting period for new application after the request has been acted on by the county board whether the use is approved or de nied this waiting period is waived if the zoning board of appeals determines that the new application shows that there has been substantial change in circumstances since the county board action for large scale developments which will be considered beginning on page of this guide as special case if the large scale review committee finds that the proposed large scale project does not meet the requirements of the ordinance the planning commission must provide written note for the developer which describes the deficiencies in the plan once the deficiency is corrected the planning commission must transmit the proposed large scale plan to the county planning zoning and subdivision committee as called for in the ordinance springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission zoning some special zoning situations what if the use on property was legal use but the zoning law has changed most likely it will be considered legal nonconforming use and is still allowed this situation and its limi tations such as discontinuance of use damage or destruction and repairs or alterations are addressed in chapter nonconforming uses of the zoning ordinance are there performance standards in some zoning districts yes there are performance standards particularly applicable in the two industrial zoning districts i- and i- these standards are established in chapter of the ordinance and deal with such matters as noise vibration smoke and particulate matter toxic and noxious matter odorous matter fire and explo sive hazards and glare and heat other performance standards are also in code for example section establishes specific performance standards for landscape screening and lighting how are telecommunication facilities handled telecommunication facilities are considered as special class of use in the ordinance and the require ments are detailed in chapter are swimming pools addressed in the zoning code yes and they are also subject to regulation regarding placement lighting and enclosure chapter of the zoning code provides specifics as to the swimming pool regulations are adult use facilities addressed in the zoning code yes adult uses are specifically addressed in chapter of the ordinance and the uses identified as adult are defined these uses are only permitted as cpu in the b- service business district since uses are also allowed in the i- and i- industrial classifications the section notes that those desiring to place an adult use on property zoned industrial must also petition for cpu special requirements are established for this use this use may not be operated within feet of resi dential zoning or agricultural zoning district that is improved with residential uses and or schools and or churches and no adult use may be operated within feet of any two other adult uses can put more than one principle building on lot only in two special cases no more than one principal building is allowed on lot or parcel in any residen tial district except in the case of an approved large scale development or planned unit develop ment these types of development will be considered later in this guide accessory buildings which are subordinate building or portion of principal building are allowed if their use is incidental and customary to that of the principal building accessory buildings and structures are subject to regula tion and these regulations can be found in chapter of the code if property or portion of property is in floodplain is construc tion prohibited while various other regulations may apply the zoning code says that no building or structure can be erected with the elevation of floor including basement floor lower than one foot above the base flood elevation established by the national flood insurance program or the best available data those enter taining construction within floodplain or on property that may contain floodplain are strongly encour aged to contact the sscrpc to discuss the various regulations that may apply floodplain development is discussed further on page springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission some advice on zoning requests zoning should meet with the zoning administrator or planning commission staff prior to submitting zoning request as was mentioned at the beginning of this section pre-application meeting is not required it is advis able however as it may help you to identify and address issues with your petition before it begins going through the zoning process this can save both time and money how much information do need to provide in my petition the application requires certain specific information but it is to your benefit to provide as much informa tion and as accurately as possible remember the application is your petition it is not the responsibil ity of zoning and sscrpc staff or the zba to find evidence supporting your case that is your responsi bility what kind of evidence should try to provide in my petition that largely depends upon the nature of your request for example both cpus and variances require that certain conditions be met for this relief to be granted if you are seeking cpu or variance you should be aware of these requirements and provide evidence in your petition as to how your request meets them should talk to my neighbors about my request prior to filing you are not required by ordinance to discuss your request with adjoining property owners but it is very good thing to do remember that your request will not be private it will be posted in the paper as well as on the property that you wish to rezone adjacent property owners will also be notified of the zoning hearing by mail your application is public docu ment and is available for review meeting with those around you who might be affected by change in zon ing will give you the opportunity to fill them in on your request and why you are making it allow you to hear of any concerns that they might have that can be addressed by making changes in your request and give you some idea as to whether or not your neighbors will support or oppose your petition remember also that valid written protest from adjacent property owners significantly increases the number of votes necessary for petition to be approved by the county board should come to the hearings yes the ordinance does not require that you or your agent for exam ple your attorney attend but it is highly advisable attending the hear ing before the zoning board of appeals and then the county board gives you the opportunity to present evidence concerning your petition answer questions that the review bodies may have or that might arise from the sscrpc staff recommendation and respond to any testimony presented by opponents it also gives you the opportunity to respond to any amendments to your request or conditions that the zba or county board might recommend or require springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission land part land development procedures what is involved in land development review sangamon county has an established review system to regulate and control the division of land within its subdivision approval jurisdiction this system of regulation is spelled out in title of the county code of ordinances as land subdivision regulations there are three purposes for this land development review spelled-out in the ordinance the first is to provide for the legal and orderly division of land by requiring proper description monumentation and re cording of the subdivided land the second is to promote growth which protects the public health safety and welfare and provides essential public services to existing and future residents and the third is to promote growth that protects the county natural resources though the ordinance is termed land subdivision regulations it is important to understand that it ap plies to more than what one might generally think of as subdivision the ordinance defines subdivision of land as the division of land into or more parts any of which is less than acres of size with some exemptions dedication of streets or easements of access creation of planned unit development see page creation of large scale developments see page or ac tions resulting in new description of land not previously recorded one might assume that the county jurisdiction includes all of the unincorporated area but it does not subdivisions of property located within miles of the corporate limits of villages or cit ies that have adopted an official plan most often called comprehensive plan in accordance with chapter of the illinois compiled statutes and filed that plan with the sscrpc are exempt for the application of any less restrictive regula tions of the county code but are required to comply with the more restrictive regulations this is because these municipalities have authority to exercise their control over mile extra territorial jurisdiction by county code when an unincorporated area lies within overlapping extra territorial jurisdictions the sscrpc shall decide which regulations are more or less restrictive based upon professional principles of land use planning to large extent the purpose of the process devised by the ordinance is to move division of property to legal and appropriate platting and the ordinance requires that proper plat be filed with some ex ceptions that are listed in ordinance sec most often this platting will require approvals at three stages of the land division review process  location and sketch maps  preliminary plan and  final plat this section of the primer addresses the requirements of these stages the process for what are called minor subdivisions is different and will be addressed beginning on page springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission stages of the development review process land what is the review the land subdivision review process in process general pre-application meeting as noted on the previous page often land optional development will require approvals at three stages location and sketch maps pre liminary plan and final plat during submission of location sketch maps review and rec which various bodies are involved in the ommendation by sscrpc land subdivision committee development review this is most often termed the land subdivision process sscrpc full commission review recommendation the diagram to the right shows the general process steps required to move from loca county board action tion and sketch maps to final plat each stage in the process requires that the sub divider or developer provide additional in approval deny formation as to his or her plans for the de velopment submission preliminary plan review and recommenda tion by sscrpc land subdivision committee information concerning what is required in each stage is provided in this part of the guide sscrpc full commission action approval deny submission review of construction plans by county engineer county engineer action change approval without changes submission of final plat review and recommen dation by sscrpc land subdivision committee county board action approve deny signed and recorded final plat springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission land location sketch maps what are location and sketch maps location and sketch maps addressed in chapter of the land subdivision regulations are intended to determine the suitability of site for subdividing and subsequent development since they are parts of one submission they are sometimes discussed in the singular map instead of maps but since county ordinance uses the plural we will do so here as well suitability of site for subdividing and development is measured by conformance with the comprehensive plan effect on natural resources and natural systems ability to provide adequate essential services to the site and conformance with the goals of the land subdivision regulations as the title indicates the location and sketch review basically involves consideration of items represented on maps showing general plans for development and is the first phase in the land subdivision process example of location sketch map springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission information included on location sketch maps land what information is required to information to be included on be included on location and location map north point scale and date sketch maps outline of the entire contiguous area owned or controlled by the subdivider with the location map is intended to show the area approximate boundary dimensions and where the subdivision will occur and the existing total acreage basic infrastructure in the area it consists of data general land legal description of the area added to an existing base map of suitable scale existing streets and roads expected to covering an area of at least one mile radius from serve the area to be subdivided and their the tract proposed for development the informa rights-of way row tion required on the location map is listed to the existing utility lines expected to serve the right area to be subdivided the sketch map focuses on the tract to be subdi vided its basic features and how it might change information to be included on it shows the general layout and character of the sketch map entire contiguous area owned or controlled by the north point scale and date subdivider the scale must be no more than the area to be subdivided and its general ft to the inch and exact dimensions or engineer dimensions ing plans are not required at this stage the general land legal description of the area sketch map must provide the information shown the proposed street network and align on the right ments with existing streets in addition the subdivider is also required to pro general lot layout vide title for the proposed subdivision and con potential open space public parks exist tact information for the owner subdivider engi ing waterways drainage or retention ar neer and land surveyor as well as other informa eas etc tion the other information to be included is listed outstanding or unusual natural features to the right and vegetation floodplain aside from the information indicated above the outstanding or unusual cultural re sscrpc may require any other information it sources feels necessary to determine site suitability or adequacy of mitigating factors some other information to be included proposed use and approximate number of housing units existing and proposed zoning method of sewage disposal method of water supply electric service provider fire protection district school district other utilities serving the site same scale sketch map with soil con servation service scs soil types over laid test well data for each lot an agreement to improve access roads springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission land location sketch maps site suitability what is considered during location and sketch maps review the purpose of location and sketch maps review is to determine the suitability of the site to be subdi vided four essential and public services are considered during this review the first two of these are sewage disposal public sanitary sewer service is the preferred method of disposal and must be used if available the conditions determining availability are listed on the right if public sanitary sewer is not available private sewage system may be used if proper soil conditions exist on one-half acre per lot which must be contiguous and regularly shaped and have appropriate soils identified through soils mapping no surface discharge from surface discharge systems is allowed off of the lot all subdivisions with or more buildable lots must be served by public sanitary sewer central or clustered sewage disposal system is required for all subdivisions of lots some land where public sewer service is not available may not be suitable for private clustered or central sewage system this property shall not be subdivided water supply an illinois environmental protection agency iepa approved public water supply is the preferred method if public water is currently available to the site it must be used the box to the right provides the conditions for determining availability private well may be permitted if the subdivider can demonstrate that adequate water is available by drilling test well at an appropriate location and the sangamon county dept of public health determines that the water meets its standards if water is not available to site it may not be subdivided the criteria for determining sewage disposal and water supply availability are shown in the box below sewage disposal system availability sanitary sewer is considered available to single-family or duplex subdivision if it is within distance of ft per lot shown on the location and sketch map or preliminary plan measured from the end of the sewer to the nearest point of the subdivision along the probable extension route as determined by the sewer providing agency for multi-family and non-residential subdivisions sanitary sewer is considered available if it is within ft per lot extensions along the subdivision boundary is not included in the distance to be extended water supply availability public water supply is considered available to single-family or duplex subdivision if it is located within ft per lot and within ft per lot for multi-family and non residential subdivisions measured from the start of the main extension to the nearest point of the subdivision along the probable extension route as determined by the public water agency springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission site suitability review continued land the other two essential and public services considered in assessing site suitability during location and sketch maps review are fire protection land proposed to be subdivided must be within fire protection district if it is not it cannot be subdivided the temporary assignment to fire protection district does not qualify property as being in district access the suitability of access roads to the land shall be evaluated by the county engineer in con sultation with the appropriate township highway commissioner using safety and durability standards and cross sections included in the ordinance as well as the illinois dept of transportation idot manual of administrative policies as guide if the county engineer determines that the access roads to the land are not suitable the land cannot be subdivided as an alternative if the access roads are found unsuitable for conventional or minor sub division the minor subdivision will be addressed later in this guide and the subdivider wishes to bring the roads up to the required standards the subdivider may enter into contract with the county and ap plicable township to do so the subdivider must provide an acceptable surety to guarantee this work in addition the subdivider is generally required to produce an agreement with the appropriate township highway commissioner demonstrating that the subdivider will respect the load requirements on the town ship access roads and be responsible for any damage done by construction equipment serving the sub division during development subdivision access road standards conventional subdivision  right-of way  road bed  pavement with shoulders  aggregate base course or equivalent minor subdivision  right-of way  road bed  pavement with shoulders depending upon adt  aggregate base course or equivalent springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission land site suitability review continued what else is considered during location and sketch maps review along with the review of essential and public services other requirements are considered during loca tion and sketch maps review to help determine site suitability they include  the site must be in conformance with sangamon county adopted comprehensive plan  development must not be located in an environmentally sensitive area unless the subdivider can show that environmental concerns can be mitigated environmentally sensitive areas include but are not limited to sites adjacent to lake springfield the proposed hunter lake or the sangamon river and their tributaries sites in or adjacent to dedicated nature preserves wildlife corridors greenways stream corridors floodplains wooded areas and wetlands  site must be of shape size and terrain so that usable lots and streets in conformance with the land subdivision regulations can and will be created to achieve conformance the site may require special design or may require the contemporaneous subdividing of adjacent property  development must not have major conflict with existing use of adjacent property waste water treatment plants power plants major industrial plants landfills certain agricultural uses etc unless it is shown that factors which cause the conflict can and will be mitigated  development must not cause major off-site impacts and problems relating to but not limited to streets drainage water system or parks if it is determined by the sscrpc that major off-site im pacts will result the subdivider must agree to mitigate the portion of the impact caused by the subdi vision is there farm exemption from some requirements there is limited farm exemption in the code subdivisions created as result of the farm exemp tion provided in sec of the sangamon county zoning ordinance pertaining to the one-time exemption of bulk requirements in the a- district see page of this guide do not need to meet the location and sketch maps submission requirements related to showing all contiguous property nor do these properties need to meet the fire protection and road access requirements they must however comply with the road repair requirements springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission land location sketch maps review process how does the location and sketch maps the location and sketch review process begin maps review process it begins with the subdivider submitting copies of the location and sketch maps and supporting data by am on the 3rd monday of the month preceding the month in which the subdi pre-application meeting vider wishes the subdivision to be reviewed if they are submitted optional after this deadline they will not be considered at the next monthly planning commission meeting delaying review submission of location and are there any limitations to getting sketch map copies to reviewed sscrpc there can be two first if the plans are not complete as per the requirements of the code then review might be delayed until all distribution of copies for of the requirements for submission have been met review but additionally sec provides that in no case shall location and sketch maps be accepted for review for subdivider who has failed to have all the required improvements written comments received on prior subdivision completed and approved by the county and summarized engineer within two years of the date of approval of the construc tion plans or if security was accepted in lieu of construction if the construction is not completed and approved within two years of the county engineer approval of the final plat more about sscrpc land subdivision the final plat later in this guide the county engineer may waive committee meeting and this provision only if it is determined that the cause for failure to hearing recommendation complete the improvements within the two year period is beyond made to full sscrpc the control of the subdivider and good faith effort is being made to complete the improvements hearing before full sscrpc if no lots have been sold from the prior subdivision and if the sub sscrpc recommends divider withdraws his or her request for approval of the construc approval or denial tion plans and vacates recorded final plat the provision does not apply assuming there are no problems with the review by county board public health safety and submission who receives the plans zoning committee the planning commission staff distributes the plans to those transmission to county board who will review them along with the sscrpc staff the plans go to members of the rpc land subdivision committee the county engineer who also provides copy to the appropriate county board hearing and township highway commissioner the appropriate fire water and action school districts the county dept of public health the county soil and water conservation district and the county zoning department all of these bodies must transmit their written com ments regarding the suitability of the site to the sscrpc within approve deny one week of receipt the rpc staff then prepares written sum mary of the comments taking into account the suitability criteria in the regulations and conformance with the comprehensive plan springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission land location and sketch map review process continued who then reviews the location and sketch maps after the comments are collected and summarized meeting is held of the rpc land subdivision committee land-sub as this committee is sometimes called reviews the suitability of the site based on the criteria provided in the regulations and conformance with the comprehensive plan and makes rec ommendation to the springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission members along with recommending that the plans be approved or not approved the land subdivision committee may recommend that the plans be approved subject to certain corrections or changes being made in this situation and assuming that the subdivider is willing to make the corrections and changes the plans will not go forward until the corrections and changes are made if the subdivider does not wish to make the corrections or changes the plans will still go forward in the process but most likely with land subdi vision committee recommendation that the location and sketch maps not be approved the review by the full -member planning commission involves public hearing and legal notice of the hearing must be placed in newspaper of general circulation within the sangamon county area days before the date of the hearing the subdivider is responsible for the cost of the notice and must present proof of publication to the planning commission before the location and sketch maps may be reviewed following the hearing the planning commission makes recommendation to the sangamon county board with respect to the suitability of the site conformance with the comprehensive plan and confor mance with the regulations governing location and sketch maps unless the subdivider requests delay the sscrpc must make its recommendation to approve or deny the plans no later than the commission regularly scheduled meeting in the second month after the subdivision was filed what happens if the planning commission makes negative recom mendation if the subdivider receives negative recommendation from the sscrpc and still wishes to proceed with the subdivision the subdivider must request in writing within days that the rpc forward the proposed subdivision along with the rpc recommendation to the sangamon county clerk for referral to the san gamon county board who makes the final decision regarding approval of the location and sketch maps the county board does after receiving the planning commission recommendation the county board public health safety and zoning committee reviews the location and sketch maps and makes recommendation to the county board the county board will then either approve or disapprove the loca tion and sketch maps based upon the same criteria and conditions referred to previously by ordinance the board must make its decision within days of its referral to the sangamon county clerk how long are location and sketch maps valid once approved location and sketch maps are valid for one year after county board approval if preliminary plan which will be addressed in the next section of this primer has not been submitted within the one year period approval of the maps expires once it expires if interest is renewed in subdividing the property at later time the entire location and sketch maps review process must be repeated the location and sketch maps approval is also only valid as long as all land area contained in the maps remains in the subdivision if any land is removed from the subdivision the sketch map and any subsequent preliminary plan approvals are rescinded any additional subdividing must again start and the location and sketch maps review stage springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission common questions about location sketch land do need to attend any meetings concerning the location and sketch maps yes there are meetings that the developer or subdivider of property should attend as the previous sections noted location and sketch maps are reviewed by the sscrpc land subdivision committee the full regional planning commission and the county board at all of these meetings questions about the development may be asked of the developer or subdivider by members of these bodies and some times the public if questions arise it is beneficial for the developer or an authorized agent to be present to answer them also since the land subdivision committee may approve the location and sketch maps subject to cer tain changes being made or conditions met it is important for developer subdivider or their represen tative to attend this meeting to address any changes that might be required and have better under standing of them other interested parties might also wish to attend these meetings in order to obtain better understand ing of development project as it goes through the land subdivision approval process what happens after final review once the location and sketch maps are approved by the county board the developer may pick up the signed plans from the sangamon county clerk office and proceed with the preliminary plan process this process will be discussed in the next section of this guide does final review allow someone to begin construction no the location and sketch maps provide site suitability analysis once the location and sketch maps are approved by the county board the developer will know how the site can be subdivided and the nec essary improvements that will be required springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission land the preliminary plan what is preliminary plan the preliminary plan typically the preliminary plan is the second stage in the review process land subdivision review process and follows the location and sketch maps where the location and sketch maps primarily addresses the suitability of the site for subdivision pre-application meeting and development the preliminary plan begins to address optional aspects related to the actual development of the property however and as its name indicates the preliminary plan is not intended to be the final plan for development instead submission of preliminary plan it is intended to provide the additional detail that will give the subdivision form and shape allowing those reviewing copies to sscrpc the subdivision to determine whether the plan will work this being the case the preliminary plan provides more detailed layout of the proposed subdivision showing the distribution of copies for location of public improvements such as roads sewers review and other utilities lots including such things as their loca tion and width and right-of ways associated with the devel opment drainage open space areas and detailed soils mapping sscrpc land subdivision committee meeting and many of the items contained in the preliminary plan are hearing technical in nature and may even involve computations for recommendation made to full example for storm water drainage so that those reviewing sscrpc the plan can make an accurate preliminary determination as to the plan effectiveness in meeting these needs what is the review process for hearing before full sscrpc sscrpc recommends preliminary plan approval of denial the diagram to the right describes the process for prelimi nary plan review as with the location and sketch maps it begins with submission of the plan to the regional planning commission as with location and sketch maps these approve deny plans are reviewed by the sscrpc land subdivision committee which then makes recommendation to the full planning commission this is where the process differs from the location and sketch map review process sscrpc appeal to exec director county board rather than the full planning commission making recom endorses plan allowed mendation to the county board the commission makes final decision to approve or deny the plan the due proc ess rights of the subdivider are addressed by an appeals process allowing the subdivider to appeal denial by the planning commission to the county board this process is further described in more detail on page of this guide springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission the preliminary plan continued land what information must preliminary plan contain the preliminary plan must address many more items than the location and sketch maps and be in scale of no more than ft to the inch as it is more detailed than the location and sketch maps all dimensions must be to the nearest foot the preliminary plan must also be consistent with the require ments of the current zoning district classification for the property the next page lists the items required to be shown on the preliminary plan and may be used as checklist some items on this list for example the proposed storm drainage system and proposed location of sewer mains are allowed to be listed on supplemental sheets example of preliminary plan springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission land the preliminary plan continued what information must preliminary plan contain checklist the title under which the proposed subdivision is to be recorded the names and addresses of the engineer registered land surveyor subdivider and owner of the tract with the name address and phone number of the contact person to whom any notice is to be sent north point scale and date of preparation and date of any revisions notation stating preliminary plan not to be recorded by recorder of deeds total acreage location of all present property and section lines the location of all streets watercourses and other existing features within the area to be subdivided and within ft of the site location and dimensions of existing buildings and their proposed disposition the existing utilities drainage courses and culverts the location and size of water mans and sewer outlets within the area to be subdivided and on the adjacent land contours referring to the geological survey datum with intervals of two feet or less unless greater inter val is required because of terrain the elevation of the -year floodplain if any portion of the land to be subdivided would be submerged by the flood all required lot area must be provided above the elevation of the year floodplain lot numbers proposed location of sewer mains the proposed storm drainage system including preliminary drainage computations an assessment of long term erosion sedimentation and runoff changes caused by the subdivision proposed location of water mains and fire hydrants location and width to the nearest foot of all proposed streets alleys and their associated rights-of way location and width to the nearest foot of lots location and width to the nearest foot of all utility easements the subdivider shall determine the correct loca tion of all easements to be shown on the preliminary plan from the utility companies location and width to the nearest foot of watercourse protection easements the location of areas to be reserved for public use size and location of open space and recreation area if required preliminary calculations for size of central or cluster sewage system if required area reserved for central or cluster sewage system if required detailed soils map location and dimensions of half acre reserved for individual private sewage disposal system and location of well site if required areas restricted from use for private sewage disposal systems along easements watercourses and floodplain and on unsuitable soils proposed staging of final plats based on traffic utilities and other factors which would determine the sequence of development with the least impact on existing residents the county and township draft of subdivision covenants relating to the requirements of this title of county code written approval of the location of the access by the governmental entity with road jurisdiction draft mitigation plan for environmentally sensitive areas if needed springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission preliminary plan review land how does the preliminary plan review process begin similar to the location and sketch maps process the preliminary plan review process begins with the subdivider submitting copies of the plan to the sscrpc along with receipt from the county clerk showing that the filing fee was paid these plans need to be filed by am on the 4th monday of the month preceding the month in which the subdivider wishes the plans to be reviewed as with the loca tion and sketch maps if preliminary plan is submitted after this deadline review will be delayed by an additional month plans should be complete and contain all of the information required by code for review the submis sion of incomplete plans may cause delays upon receipt of the plans the planning commission retains copies for its own review and use and then provides copies to the members of the sscrpc land subdivision committee the county engineer who provides copy to the relevant township highway commissioner the sangamon county dept of public health the sangamon county zoning dept and to any other affected agencies such as school districts serving the area to be subdivided how are preliminary plans reviewed as noted on page the review of preliminary plans is similar to the review of location and sketch maps with one important exception the springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission members rather than the county board take final action to approve or deny after plans including the required information have been submitted they are reviewed by the sscrpc land subdivision committee this committee is tasked with determining whether or not the plans meet regulatory and other requirements based upon this review the land subdivision committee makes recommendation to the full -member planning commission that the plans be approved or denied in some cases the land subdivision committee may recommend approval subject to certain changes or corrections being made in the plans in these cases the plans are held from final action until the changes and corrections are made if the subdivider does not wish to make the changes or corrections the pro ject would still go forward to the full planning commission for decision but it would likely go forward with negative land subdivision committee recommendation the full planning commission receives the recommendation of the land subdivision committee along with any other appropriate information including public comments during the commission meeting and then must approve or disapprove the preliminary plan approval or disapproval must be decided no later than the planning commission regularly scheduled meeting in the second month after the plans were filed unless the subdivider requests delay can the preliminary plan be submitted at the same time as the loca tion and sketch maps in order to speed-up the process yes preliminary plan is sometimes filed at the same time as the location and sketch maps that is permissible as the preliminary plan may be filed and the land subdivision committee may review it be fore the sangamon county board has approved the location and sketch maps however no review by the full planning commission will take place and no decision will be made by the commission on the preliminary plan until the location and sketch maps are approved by the sangamon county board the plans will be held by the planning commission until the county board acts springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission land preliminary plan review continued what happens if the planning commission recommends disapproval if the planning commission disapproves the plans the subdivider has two options the first is to amend the plans and resubmit them these amended plans will then go through the same process as the origi nal plans did the second is to appeal the decision sec to appeal the subdivider must file petition with the county clerk within days of the adverse decision asking for an appeal to the county board this petition must point out those parts of the decision to which the subdivider objects public hearing is then conducted by the county board after one week notice has been mailed by the county clerk to the sub divider during this hearing the board reviews the sufficiency or the propriety of the preliminary plan in light of the planning commission decision at the conclusion of this hearing the county board may affirm or mod ify the decision of the planning commission or approve the preliminary plan once approved how long is preliminary plan valid preliminary plan is valid for years after planning commission approval if final plat has not been submitted to the sscrpc within that years or if submitted has not been approved by the sangamon county board the preliminary plan expires can preliminary plan be extended beyond three years if subdivider has not submitted final plat within the years that preliminary plan is valid but wishes to avoid the expiration of the plan he or she may seek reaffirmation of the plan by submitting copies of the plan to the sscrpc accompanied by receipt for the filing fee by am on the 4th monday of the 35th month following planning commission approval if the subdivider has submitted final plat within the year period but it has not been approved by the sangamon county board he or she may avoid expiration of the plan in the same manner as above provided that if the final plat is disapproved by the county board during or after the 35th month the submission is required to be made within one month of the disapproval preliminary plan may be reaffirmed one time after each final plat approval if final plat has not been submitted to the sscrpc within years of the date of reaffirmation it expires final plat approval also extends the validity of the preliminary plan for years from the date of approval of the final plat by the county board though the sscrpc may require any necessary changes in the event preliminary plan expires the subdivider wishing to proceed with the development must re submit location and sketch maps for review and proceed as would be the case of an original submittal if subdivider wishes to develop property in stages does this need to be addressed in the preliminary plan yes if subdivider wishes to record and develop property in stages he or she may do so but the staging needs to be approved as part of the preliminary plan review this becomes important in terms of the subdivider options on recording the final plat in stages the final plat is considered in later section of this guide springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission construction plans land what are construction plans construction plans are intended to show the design of the public improvements so that determination can be made as to whether county standards are met and whether the improvements are compatible with existing public improvements construction plans are submitted following approval of preliminary plan and before submission of final

large scale developments most often simply referred to as large scales should be considered under the county land subdivision regulations because of their name it is instead considered in chapter of the zoning ordinance because it primarily addresses set of special situations related to use and compatibility when division of land is not involved the large scale development regulations and process applies to any tract of land on which more than one principal building will be located and manufactured home parks what plans and supporting documents are required when large scale project is proposed the developer builder must submit the physical development plans for the project to the sscrpc for review and recommendation to the county board these plans must be prepared at scale of to feet-per

within seven days this commit tee is made up of the county engineer the appropriate township highway commissioner and the san gamon county zoning administrator if following its review the committee determines that the plans con form to county regulations the sscrpc sends copy of the submission and recommendation for ap proval to the county board committee that considers planning zoning and subdivisions this recom mendation is contingent upon the county engineer certifying that all required improvements have been constructed satisfactorily or that certified check or satisfactory bond guaranteeing completion of such construction has been provided if this phase of the process is completed the county board committee agrees and the county engineer certifies the improvement the chairman of the county committee may approve the large scale project if the large scale review committee finds that the project does not meet the requirements of ordinance the sscrpc provides written note to the developer builder noting the deficiencies once any deficien cies are addressed action on the project can be taken springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission special special types planned unit developments types what is planned unit development pud planned unit development or pud is special type of development defined in both the county zoning ordinance and its land subdivision regulations the definition of pud is addressed in both places because pud is intended to provide the flexibility of land use necessary to encourage the creation of new and more desirable man-made environment by providing greater of uses on site than would normally be allowed in typical zoning district for purposes of county zoning pud is defined as any area or tract of land under single or common ownership to be developed as single entity and classified in pud zoning district the land subdivision ordinance provides additional criteria in its definition defining pud as form of land subdivision that allows the development of ten or more acres of land with variations of some of the restrictions of standard zoning and subdivision regulations under the pud zoning classification the developer of or more acres of land is offered the opportunity to stretch for the best possible arrangement and inter-relationship of streets land use and buildings on the land through the planning designing and layout process the more traditional design limits imposed by zoning district use and bulk requirements as well as by the separate requirements of the land subdivision regulations are removed for the pud developer he or she is given free hand to work toward the achievement of goals and objectives of the county comprehensive plan and to develop layouts that will result in wider range of settings for contemporary way of life when is pud allowed pud can be considered for the development of acres or more where there is common ownership and the development is to be planned designed laid-out and developed by single entity as one might suspect given the name significant part of the process for establishing pud relates to review of its planning as well as its plans as pud is intended to be development in which an entire area is uni formly planned and regulated rather than being treated like standard subdivision the pud allows for greater flexibility however since greater flexibility is allowed pud requires addi tional effort on the part of the developer as pud vests significant responsibility in the developer to plan the development and design regulations for it in this regard pud is intended for situations in which the pud petitioner will act as both subdivider and builder so that there will be uniformity throughout the devel opment creating different standards for development than would be the case if the property were simply subdivided and individual builders applied their individual visions to each parcel under existing zoning and subdivision rules and regulations what is the process for requesting pud since pud offers the opportunity for the developer to stretch beyond more traditional design limits the process for pud review is not specifically enumerated in county ordinance as it is intended that the plan ning of pud be carried out as partnership between the developer and the county reviewing agen cies for this reason and to greater extent than other forms of development developers and property owners are strongly encourage to meet with staff of the county department of zoning as well as staff of the springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission prior to petition to es tablish pud at that time these staffs will jointly work with the developer or property owner to detail review process taking into account the unique attributes of the proposed pud since puds are handled under zoning the process will generally be the same as with other zoning cases and start with petition submitted to the zoning administrator since pud is treated as zoning district requiring zoning map amendment the filing processing posting and hearing requirements for pud are the same as those for any other zoning petition as per chapter of the county zoning ordinance springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission other part special considerations development in floodplain sometimes property owners wish to develop property that lies all or in part in floodplain development within floodplain is restricted for many reasons most importantly public health and safety restrictions on development in floodplain exist in federal state and county law this includes the county zoning ordinance sec which requires that no building or structure be erected with the elevation of floor including the basement floor being lower than one foot above the elevation of the base flood as established by the national flood insurance program or the best available data for regu latory purposes flood insurance rate maps known as firms are used to provide information to deter mine if property is in the -year floodplain copies of these maps can be reviewed and assistance provided in their interpretation by staff of the sscrpc or by the illinois department of natural resources office of water resources however even if structure is considered that would meet the county zoning ordinance it may still need floodplain development permit this permit is required for any development in the -year flood plain development activities include  construction reconstruction placement or expansion of building that exceeds square feet or is valued at more than  substantial improvement including any repair or improvement of building the cost of which is or greater than the market value of the building before work is started or before the building was damaged  placement of mobile or manufactured home  placement of travel trailer for more than days  installing utilities construction of roads or similar projects  construction of levees walls fences bridges or culverts  placement of fill excavating drilling mining dredging or grading  storage of materials including gas and liquid storage tanks  stream or river channel modifications development typically does not include the maintenance of existing structures such as the re-roofing of buildings or the resurfacing of roads or agricultural practices such as gardening and plowing floodplain development permit applications are available from the sscrpc or the county website www co sangamon il us applications must include  description of the project  scale drawing of the site  existing and proposed ground elevations fill excavation and or lowest floor elevations of struc ture  engineer certificate and calculations for fill  permit or waiver from the illinois department of natural resources office of water resources  permit fee the permit application should be submitted to the sscrpc inspections of the project will then be ar ranged with an engineer and the engineer will then review the documentation and inspect the property following this review notification will be sent to the property owner either with permit or with letter stating the reasons for denial of the permit springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission special considerations continued other extra-territorial jurisdiction while the information in this guide is intended to address development regulations applicable to the unin corporated areas of sangamon county those areas outside of the boundaries of city or village we noted on page that in some situations sangamon county land development regulations may not ap ply this is because illinois law allows municipalities meeting certain conditions to apply their develop ment rules and regulations beyond their corporate limits into the unincorporated areas state law allows municipality to exercise what is called extra-territorial jurisdiction for land development purposes within miles of its corporate limits if it has an official plan most often called comprehensive plan approved in accordance with chapter of the illinois compiled statues has filed that plan with the sscrpc included the extra-territorial land in its comprehensive plan and has applica ble land subdivision regulations in place when these conditions are met the property located within miles of the corporate limits of village or city is exempt for the application of any less restrictive regulations of the county code but are required to comply with the more restrictive regulations of the city or village exercising its extra-territorial jurisdic tion it is possible that extra-territorial jurisdictions can overlap by county code when an unincorporated area lies within overlapping extra-territorial jurisdictions the sscrpc is to decide which regulations are more or less restrictive based upon professional principles of land use planning and apply the more restrictive regulations of the overlapping jurisdictions explanation of the law and court decisions related to extra-territorial jurisdiction go well beyond the scope of this guide but it is important for property owners developers and residents to know that this complexity exists it is also important to know that they may additionally exist regarding the applicability of zoning and land subdivi sion regulations in these extra-territorial areas this being the case those wishing to develop or subdivide property within miles of municipal jurisdiction are strongly advised to consult with both the sscrpc and the relevant city or village located near the project site to deter mine whose rules apply sscrpc staff are always available to help make this determination springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission other special considerations continued land evaluation and site assessment lesa what is lesa the land evaluation and site assessment commonly known as lesa system is tool used by the county for determining the advisability of zoning land use change from agricultural use to non agricultural use usually residential development it is useful guide for determining the relative impor tance of protecting property as farmland and promoting the county land use goals review under lesa is made up of two parts which gives the system its name the first is the land evaluation which assesses the soils on the property in terms of their suitability for crop production and the second is the site assessment which examines characteristics other than soils which contribute to the quality of the site for farming and the ability or probability of the property continuing in agricultural use the system assigns points based on the property compliance with certain identifiable and measurable criteria maximum of points for land evaluation and for site assessment is possible under the county lesa system and for the purposes of evaluating land for non-agricultural develop ment  fewer than points is deemed acceptable for non-agricultural development  score of between and points indicates that the site is considered marginal for non agricultural development and mitigating factors should be evaluated  greater than points means that the site is considered suitable for agricultural use only the higher the number of points the higher the quality of the property for agricultural use and the more likely that the site would have high development cost lack essential public services or both using point system such as lesa provides more consistent objective determination of property agricultural suit ability so the lower the point total arrived at through the lesa scoring system the greater the acceptability for non-agricultural use what is considered in lesa scoring the land evaluation component is largely technical process predetermined by the us department of agriculture under this section soils in sangamon county are grouped into nine categories by their rela tive value ranging from zero points to for example soil 36a tama soil is rated as lesa group soil and would receive points on the other hand soil orthents soil is rated in group and would receive zero points when property is evaluated under lesa the acreage of each soil group on site is determined and the property relative productivity index calculated this figure provides the land evaluation point total for the property it is important to understand that even when only portion of property is being considered for example when new parcel is being created from larger piece of land the land evaluation is done pertaining to the soils on the entire piece not just those on the parcel to be divided off the site assessment section addresses factors other than soils that can affect the quality of the site in the future as farmland the site assessment factors were developed based upon two simple land use plan ning observations that generally the more suitable site is for urban uses the less suitable it is for agri culture and conversely the more suitable the site is for agriculture the less suitable it is for residential uses and the higher the initial and continuing cost if it were developed springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission special considerations continued other the site assessment factors are divided into three categories  agricultural land use points this factor assesses the feasibility of the site remaining in agri cultural use by looking at the amount of agriculture near the site and the site actual use maximum points are given if the area and site are agriculturally oriented  compatibility impact of uses points this assesses the impact the proposed use would have on existing uses the environment and historic features the greater the adverse impact of proposed use the greater the points given  existing infrastructure points this assesses the suitability of the site for residential uses by measuring the distance of the site from essential public services if public services are available the site is felt to be more suitable for development other than agriculture nearness to public services indi cates that the site is adjacent to or very close to existing urban areas and that the municipality plans to encourage development in that area encouraging development according to city or village com prehensive plan should save farmland in the long run for these reasons few points are awarded if public services are available what is considered under the agricultural land use factor under the agricultural land use factor the percent of land used for agriculture within one-half mile ra dius of the site provides general view of the current agricultural character of the area generally areas which are largely agriculture are more viable for continued farming use adjacent land uses in agriculture are also strong indicator of the character of the area as the greater the proportion of contiguous land in agricultural use the greater the potential for conflicts if the site is changed from farmland the determina tion of surrounding land uses can help identify the types of nuisance complaints that may arise and fi nally the current use of the site is an indicator of the feasibility of the site for agricultural use if little of the site is being used for agricultural purposes it may indicate along with the land evaluation that the site is not of much agricultural importance what is considered under the compatibility impact of uses factor four aspects of the site are considered here first the location of the site in relation to springfield or other incorporated areas as this is important in assessing the probability of the land remaining in agriculture the closer the site is to an incorporated area the more likely that the site will be developed development contiguous to an incorporated area is more desirable than leapfrog development away from an urban area so site located next to an incorporated area receives zero points assessment of the site suitability to handle an on-site waste disposal system is also considered under this factor and is based on the sangamon county soil suitability map rating for the site soils with severe restrictions for septic tanks can increase the cost of development and there is the risk of the system not functioning properly and polluting streams and groundwater for these reasons sites with severe soil re strictions for septic tanks are better left for agriculture and receive points this factor also considers the impact the new use would have on the environment and natural features in comparison to the existing land use the proposed use would have negative impact for example if it caused surface runoff problems it was in floodplain or it destroyed important local wildlife habitat or un usual vegetation and finally the compatibility impact of uses factor considers any historical or cultural features that might be adversely affected by change in land use these would include the presence of historic sites land marks or markers architecturally unique areas or archeological sites springfield-sangamon county regional planning commission other special considerations continued what is considered under the existing infrastructure factor five items are considered in terms of existing infrastructure transportation accessibility central sewer public water supply distance from firehouse and distance from high school the type of road which serves property is an indication of its general quality and ability to absorb in creased traffic increasing non-agricultural related traffic on rural roads creates demands for widening various improvements and increased standards of maintenance conflicts between cars and farm vehi cles can also result if the road is not adequate needed improvements and maintenance can cause an increase in taxes placing burden on the farmer poor roads are therefore weighted against develop ment and toward keeping the land in agriculture the availability of central sewer system to the site implies nearness to urban areas and decision to open the land for development the farther the sewer must be extended to reach the site the greater the probability the site should not yet be developed and should remain in agriculture public health interests favor central sewers over septic systems that may malfunction leaking effluent into groundwater or streams as with availability of central sewers the availability of public water indicates municipality desire for the area to develop as with some of the other measures distance from firehouse is reverse measure of agriculture capa bility measuring the site suitability for urban development fire protection is an essential public service and its adequacy is measured in response time for fire fighting equipment to arrive at the site the bet ter the response time and fire protection service the fewer points given toward maintaining agricultural use

specifically plants listed in section of the city of durham reference guide for development or in chapters and of the ncdeq stormwater bmp manual for use in stormwater best management practices bmps or stormwater control measures scms but not otherwise listed in the landscape manual are not subject to approval through the landscape manual and can be used for these specific applications landscape plans landscape plans shall be prepared by person demonstrating knowledge and experience in the field of landscaping or site design such as landscape architect landscape designer landscape contractor or horticulturist the landscape plan shall adequately detail the requirements of the udo and this manual plans shall include the following plant list or table showing quantity scientific names common names sizes and intended uses and key that identifies the species of all plant material on the landscape plan it may also contain notes that further define characteristics of the plant that the designer wants in the plant selection matching specimens the size of the proposed plant material sizes of upright shrubs as described in udo paragraph 3c shrubs shall be specified by height only tree sizes as described in udo paragraph 3b trees shall be shown by caliper or height as applicable container sizes are not allowed to be used in lieu of height and caliper if provided note must be included on the plant list stating container sizes listed are in addition to the required height and caliper minimums shown the location of all required landscape materials including trees shrubs and structural elements both existing and proposed the planting area in square feet proposed to be provided for each tree the planting area shall meet or exceed the minimum required root growth area for the applicable species listed in table 1a allowed deciduous trees and table 1b allowed evergreen trees the location of preserved tree coverage and tree replacement areas as applicable the location of

paragraph 1c standards per udo paragraph 5a easements plantings proposed within easements shall be approved by the utility provider trees proposed for planting within overhead electrical line power line easements shall use tree species approved for use under the power lines by the operating utility some of these allowable trees are noted with in the street trees under power lines column of the approved use categories portion of table 1a allowed deciduous trees and table 1b allowed evergreen trees specific written permission from the utility operating the easement shall be provided for any trees proposed for planting within overhead utility easements other than those so allowed in the landscape manual if an overhead utility is not located within an easement or public right-of way it is recommended that tree plantings have minimum setback of feet from the centerline of the overhead utility if tree is proposed to be planted within this recommended setback to meet udo requirement only tree species approved for use under power lines should be planted plants should not be placed where they will block or interfere with the operation of site features and utilities location of plantings near utilities such as those associated with fire safety site lighting water and sewer connections and electrical access can result in violation of other city and county code and ordinance requirements therefore the designer should show the location of all proposed utilities to verify that there are no conflicts with either underground or above-ground utilities city county and state departments and agencies that review site plans will comment on plant location proposals that violate their design manuals and ordinances on planting plans site utilities can be shown as half-toned to make it easier to see the proposed plantings and their relationship to the utilities avoid conflicts between trees and site lighting tree shadows can interfere with lighting performance which could result in violation of udo utility requirements pruning of the obstructing trees could result in the loss of an ordinance-required tree resulting in possible violation of the ordinance to avoid such conflicts the site designer should provide minimum -foot horizontal clearance from the tree trunk center to the center point of overhead lighting elements if fastigiate or columnar tree species is used the required horizontal clearance can be reduced to minimum of five feet show location of proposed irrigation lines and sprinkler heads if proposed water-wise tip shrub annual perennial and turf grass areas have different water requirements reduce over-watering by grouping plants with similar water needs into separate irrigation zones eco-friendly tip native plants are indicated by an in the allowed plant tables choose native plants suited to the conditions of the site to increase biodiversity feed birds and other wildlife provide nectar for the pollinators all creatures depend on improve the quality of our woodlands air and water help slow climate change and provide optimal habitat for beneficial insects which are crucial to life on earth tree preservation and care before and during construction tree preservation see paragraph protection of existing vegetation of the udo procedures per udo paragraph protection of existing vegetation areas of vegetation to be preserved to meet ordinance requirements shall not be disturbed or encroached upon allowed activities in preserved tree coverage areas are listed in udo paragraph 1d construction in preserved tree coverage area install tree protection fencing around areas of vegetation to be preserved in accordance with udo paragraph protection of existing vegetation see figure tree protection fence detail for an example detail of tree protection fencing the minimum size of the tree preservation area shall be the area within the tree protection zone tpz of the tree or group of trees to be preserved additional area can be preserved at the rate of feet per one inch of diameter at breast height dbh when installing tree protection fencing for preserved trees along wood edge the fence shall be located at the edge of the tpz of the outermost-protected trees and on the wooded side of any silt fencing to be installed in the same location using silt fencing or combining tree protection and silt fencing into one fence is prohibited for tree protection per udo paragraph 2c tree protection fencing including warning signs as required in udo paragraph 2e shall be installed prior to starting any grading or land disturbing activity the location of the tree protection fencing shall be inspected and approved prior to starting any grading or land disturbing activity for projects requiring land disturbance permit call the durham county engineering and environmental services stormwater and environmental division to request that sedimentation and erosion control officer visit the site to approve the placement of the fencing for projects that do not require land disturbance permit contact the city-county planning site compliance staff to schedule an inspection of the fencing prior to beginning land disturbing activities to protect the tpz of tree to be preserved contractors performing grading and other land disturbance activities near tree preservation areas shall perform such activities in accordance with udo paragraphs 2d and trees with more than third of their roots pruned or removed will be negatively impacted and could die or become unstable depending on proximity of the construction to the trunk see udo paragraphs tree coverage standards and existing trees for the minimum percentages of tpz required to be protected for specific use applications of preserved trees if existing trees which are identified to be preserved to meet ordinance requirements have more of their tpz damaged than the required maximum percentages during or after development activities revised land disturbance tree survey see udo paragraph 3b land disturbance tree survey and revised site plan shall be required in order to remove those trees from the plan see figure land disturbance tree survey for an example detail tree coverage calculations as applicable shall be adjusted accordingly the developer shall be required to demonstrate that the amount of required tree coverage area is still being provided including additional tree coverage areas if required developers designers and contractors can contact the planning department site compliance staff to arrange site visit for an evaluation of tree protection areas and permission to remove invasive damaged or diseased plant material prior to doing any of these activities water-wise tip preservation of existing trees is preferable over tree replacement for several reasons existing trees require no water to become established and can typically be maintained with rainfall areas of tree coverage absorb rainfall and allow for groundwater recharge on site undisturbed soils prevent moisture loss that can occur when soils are graded and exposed to air eco-friendly tip invasive plants negatively affect biodiversity water quality fish and wildlife habitat tree cover and fire risk and costs consult table trees not allowed for ordinance required planting credit table other plants not allowed for ordinance-required planting credit and table plants prohibited for any use for noted invasive species and to avoid these plants root pruning prior to construction procedures root pruning shall be done around single existing city-owned trees and at the edge of city or county-owned wooded areas located near proposed construction prior to the start of land disturbing activities where the critical root zone is outside the tree protection zone and will be impacted by grading no root pruning of city tree shall occur within six feet of such tree without the approval of the urban forestry manager cut roots no more than six inches back from new construction cuts shall be made to maximum depth of two feet with sharp vertical cut using an implement that will cleanly cut the root root pruning implements can be anything from sharpened shovel loppers pruning saw pavement saw or similar sharp cutting tool circumstances and availability will dictate which tools will be best for the pruning application most plows stump grinders pavement saws and sharp hand tools are acceptable if the root is cleanly cut and not mashed or torn backfill with clean dry soil within eight hours of root pruning moisten soil immediately after backfilling selection of plant material plant selection practices and plant tables plant tables as per udo paragraph plant material requirements plant material selections shall be made for ordinance-required plantings in accordance with the tables provided in this landscape manual plants allowed to be used for ordinance-required plantings and generally well-suited to durham climate and soil conditions are listed in tables 1a allowed deciduous trees and table 1b allowed trees and in table 2a allowed deciduous shrubs and table 2b allowed evergreen shrubs these tables found at the end of this section include the category of use locations such as street trees or parking lots where trees and shrubs are allowed to be used to meet ordinance requirements the plants in each table are listed in alphabetical order by their accepted horticultural or latin name the edition of the manual of woody landscape plants their identification ornamental characteristics culture propagation and uses by michael dirr was the main source of the plant names listed in these tables however plant names change over time and there may be some differences between the names listed here and in another source where more up-to date name was discovered it has been included plants not allowed trees and other plants that are not recommended for use due to invasive tendencies disease lack of hardiness or other factors are listed in table trees not allowed for ordinance required planting credit and table other plants not allowed for ordinance-required planting credit no landscaping credit is allowed for use of these plant materials table plants prohibited for any use lists plant species that are recognized by the north carolina botanical garden or by the united states department of agriculture forest service southern research station for their invasive tendencies and shall not be planted as landscaping for any purpose approval of plants not in the tables plants not found in any of the allowed trees or allowed shrubs tables can be approved for use if the proposed plant meets the specific location and use criteria in section 4c criteria for determining allowed locations for use of ordinance-required plant material of this landscape manual additionally the plant must be suitable for the proposed growing environment must not be listed as prohibited plant in this landscape manual or plant not allowed for use in this landscape manual and must be approved as non-invasive by the city of durham urban forester plant substitutes must be documented for suitability and sealed by qualified and registered north carolina registered landscape contractor or north carolina registered landscape architect the required documentation shall be provided to the planning director or designee for each such plant proposed for use in an ordinance-required planting recommendations for additions to the allowed plant lists can similarly be made to the planning director or designee to be included in periodic updates to the tables if the plants are so qualified plant selection practices drought tolerance the degree of tolerance of plant to drought conditions is indicated by the symbol as set forth in the established plant dry soil tolerance portion of the plant table key found in figure plant table key the designation assigned to each plant is provided under the plant type column of the plant tables please keep the following in mind when selecting plants for drought-tolerance most plants prefer moist well-drained soil however provided plant is otherwise healthy has had time to become established normally one to two years after planting and is provided appropriate cultural conditions adequate soil drainage and aeration mulch moderate to low fertilization proper ph appropriate light level etc those plants indicated as drought-tolerant should be able to survive moderate period of limited moisture rainfall irrigation drought tolerance does not mean the plants prefer hot dry weather or that they will not be adversely affected by extended dry weather high temperatures and wind heat and light reflection from nearby hard surfaces and high fertilization can increase the potentially damaging effects of low moisture on plant growth and survival fall-planted trees and shrubs have demonstrated an increased ability to survive moderate moisture levels compared to those transplanted in the spring or summer from ncsu drought-tolerant shrubs december water-wise tip the allowed plant tables highlight drought tolerant plants this information can be used during the design process to group plants with similar water needs and achieve landscape that is easy to maintain consider site characteristics such as soil drainage and nutrient-holding capacity preferred sun exposure and urban conditions when selecting plants plant material quality standards plant material quality within sight distance triangles plant material shall meet the requirements of udo paragraph 1d design standards per udo paragraph 3a plant materials general the physical characteristics of trees provided to meet ordinance-required plantings shall be in accordance with the american standard for nursery stock most current edition some of these characteristics include plants used shall be nursery-grown unless field harvested on-site and approved with the landscape plan typical of their species or variety with normal growth habit well-developed branch structure healthy foliage and vigorous root systems plants should be free from defects disfiguring knots sunscald injuries frost cracks abrasions of the bark plant diseases insect eggs borers fire ants and all forms of infestation balled-and burlapped plants shall include the earth in which the plant has been growing and have diameter meeting the specifications in the american standard for nursery stock burlapped root balls shall be firm and undamaged from shipping or handling the burlap used to secure the ball shall be untreated and biodegradable the top two-thirds of the burlap and wire cage shall be removed upon planting plants containing or showing evidence of congestive strongly circling girdling roots indicative of future weak root growth and poor plant performance shall not be accepted trees provided for street tree and parking applications should have straight trunks with an intact single central leader unless the tree natural form does not support central leader for example most flowering trees or japanese maples or multi-stem tree is specified trees which have had their branches shortened sheared leaders cut or have damaged leaders requiring repair shall not be accepted plants of each particular variety shall be uniform in size density and configuration typical of the particular variety plants should have fully developed form without voids and open spaces consistent with the age and species of the plant field-collected plants shall not be used to meet ordinance-required landscaping unless they have been specifically identified on the approved landscape plan and qualified plant professional see section 4a plant selection practices and plant tables certifies the method and performance of their transplanting plants used for ordinance-required landscaping and tree replacement shall be provided as specified in the plant list on the approved landscape plan if discrepancy exists between the number of plants specified in the plant list and the graphic representation on the plan the installer should use the number graphically represented on the plan prior to actual installation plants used for ordinance-required landscaping should be protected from sun and drying winds and extreme temperatures at all times plants that cannot be installed immediately upon delivery to the site should be kept in the shade or covered with burlap to prevent sun scorch plants that remain unplanted for longer than one day should be heeled in covered with wet compost soil or other acceptable material and their root ball kept moist by watering plants should not remain unplanted on site longer than three days unless temporary irrigation system is used criteria for determining allowed locations for use of ordinance-required plant material the following tables describe the typical criteria used by the planning director or designee to determine allowed locations for use of the trees and shrubs found in the plant tables at the end of this landscape manual some plants are allowed to serve more than one use both as canopy tree and as an understory tree and are therefore located within more than one table in the plant list however each site is unique and designer should consider these criteria along with the recommendations provided in the tables when selecting plants for particular project landscape requirements allowed tree table category criteria allowed use location category typical criteria for specific category of use location trees street

fence detail to protect any existing trees shrubbery and planting beds in the planting area create plant beds of the size and location shown on the approved site plan where several plants will be spaced close together they should be planted in one larger bed to allow for sharing of root space and amendment of all the soil in that bed all groundcovers and container shrubs should be planted in shrub bed see figure recommended shrub planting detail balled and burlapped material or large container material can be planted in individual planting holes provided the area surrounding the holes is supportive of root growth the planting area should be wide enough to accommodate all roots without crowding and contain nutrient-rich friable soil dig all planting holes minimum three times the width of the root ball in highly compacted or clay soils or two times the width of the root ball in all other soils with minimum of nine inches on each side of the root mass or ball for shrubs and inches for trees tree planting holes should be wider at the top with tapered sides this can be accomplished by digging with large auger to the required depth and then breaking down the sides with shovel to eliminate glazing transferring the material to the low side of the slope and creating the preferred slope the sides of the pit must be scarified avoid creating smooth or glazed sizes of the pit the bottom of the hole should be flat and firm to prevent settling do not dig or scarify the bottom of the planting hole for street trees proposed to be planted within street right-of way see figure tree planting within right-of way detail for recommended planting practices if no planting detail is provided on the approved landscape plan contact the city urban forester for more details on procedures for planting trees within city street rights-of way when applicable contact the city transportation department or ncdot as appropriate about requirements for encroachment agreements after digging plant holes confirm positive drainage by filling with water and allowing it to percolate out before setting trees and shrubs the hole should completely drain within hours if drainage is problem document solutions in writing install sufficient quantity of planting to replace the removed topsoil and to fill the hole the replacement soil should be the following planting unless otherwise specified red clay silt coarse sand to in diameter maximum organic material such as completely decomposed compost or humus the acidity range of the plant should be ph5 to ph6 the planting should have the following nutrients at the specified percent base saturation calcium at to magnesium at to and potassium at to to protect existing turf areas that will remain after completion of the project bridge-over traffic areas with sheets of plywood and cover non-traffic areas with tarps turf protection should be removed immediately as work is completed or at the end of every workday whichever is shorter remove all vegetation from the top three inches of the planting area for both planting beds and plant holes if native soil is to be used in lieu of replacement planting remove all non-organic matter stones diameter trash and large woody material over diameter test the soil to determine what nutrients may be needed and in what amounts amend with organic matter not to exceed by volume and other nutrients according to the soil test at the rates specified on the packages or in accordance with section 5c fertilizing and ph adjustment for shrubs and trees plant installation plants installed to meet ordinance requirements shall be alive and healthy at site inspection they shall remain alive and healthy and actively growing and thriving during the life of the development and for one year afterwards trees shall be planted according to figure required tree planting detail dead or missing plants will result in udo violations requiring replacement of the dead and missing plant materials prior to planting remove trees groundcover and shrubbery from their containers if their root balls are pot-bound contain strangling or girdling roots correct the roots and scarify the ball before installation for container grown trees the root collar must be exposed and circling roots must be corrected shave about one to two inches off the outer edge and bottom of the root ball then slice into the root ball radially like spokes of wheel staying about three inches away from the trunk all girdling roots must be removed set plants upright plumb and oriented to provide the best appearance and relationship to the viewer each other or adjacent structure no soil mulch stone or other materials shall cover the root flare of trees or shrubs landscape fabric is not permitted around trees or shrubs soak all container plants with water before removing them from their containers to keep the plant moist and healthy during the planting process plant trees approximately one inch above finished grade then place one inch of quality soil across the hole and the planting bed per planting details do not place backfill soil against the stems or trunks of plant material use large equipment as needed to properly set trees in pits do not bend the trunk or use the trunk as lever to move the tree ball in the pit this practice can damage the root system or cause the roots to become detached from the tree which can kill the tree backfill around the root ball of container plants being careful not to pack tightly but filling in all air pockets do not use muddy or frozen mixtures for backfilling take extra care to adequately backfill plants backfill and firm the soil around the bottom eighth of the root ball cut away the ball ties the top two-thirds of the wire basket and the exposed burlap do not remove the burlap from under the root ball backfill one-half of the remaining hole with the specified planting and water thoroughly backfill the rest of the hole with the specified planting tamp down lightly to eliminate air pockets but do not pack tightly mulch with one to two inches of mulch undyed composted hardwood mulch is recommended see section 5f mulching shrubs and trees the use of landscape fabric is not permitted it has been shown to inhibit air water and nutrient movement to the soil and roots resulting in poorly performing plantings it has also been demonstrated that weed growth is only marginally diminished for one season at most water all plants immediately after planting see section 5d watering shrubs and trees for more on watering water-wise tip new plantings should be watered deeply and thoroughly with low-pressure water-dispersing device within the drip line of the plant fertilizing and ph adjustment for shrubs and trees soil test must be performed prior to the addition of any fertilizer lime acidifier or phosphorous product only add these soil modifying chemicals based on rates dictated by soil test first determine the soil texture and infiltration rate addition of pine bark humus diameter fully composted leaf mold or small pea gravel to clay soils at rate no more than by volume will help improve drainage this will increase supply of both water and oxygen to the plants peat moss sand hardwood bark sawdust wood chips or pine straw are not recommended as amendments to clay soils addition of these amendments can also help to raise the bed which will both improve drainage and look more attractive pine bark humus composted leaf mold or peat moss will improve water retention in sandy soils if added at rate no more than by volume without soils test application of fertilizer could be detrimental to the landscape over-application or application of unneeded materials is not cost-effective can result in chemical injury to plants and nutrient imbalances unsuitable for plant growth and is environmentally unsound water-wise tip over-fertilization can also lead to increased nutrient discharge into the groundwater and surface runoff eco-friendly tip consider using organic fertilizers they contain important secondary and trace nutrients improve soil texture aeration and drainage provide slow-release nutrition and are environmentally friendly native plants require little or no fertilizer nitrogen phosphorous and potassium are the main nutrients tested calcium or magnesium may also be needed if indicated by the soil test adding too much calcium will inhibit the absorption of potassium and magnesium and many sources of calcium raise soil ph if calcium is low but ph change is undesirable gypsum can be incorporated into the soil prior to planting according to package directions fertilizers should be of slow-release variety it is better to apply them more often during the growing season than to apply once for the entire year since plants will not be able to absorb all the nutrients which is not cost-effective typically it is not recommended to fertilize at planting water-wise tip withhold fertilization during times of drought nutrient application stimulates growth and increases water needs after using soil test to determine what soil amendments fertilizer lime etc are needed incorporate recommended amendments uniformly in the top six to eight inches of the native soil using rototiller prior to planting if replacement soil is used amendments should be mixed into that soil prior to filling around plant materials where several trees or shrubs will be planted together in the same planting bed soil amendments should be spread uniformly over the entire bed do not wash loose soil amendments into stormwater inlets as they can be highly damaging to streams be careful to sweep up and remove any stray nutrients that might otherwise be washed into stormwater inlets to avoid pollution washing nutrients off hard surfaces without collecting them flushes the debris into the storm system and eventually into the riparian system and water-supply lakes be careful when applying nutrients around water bodies and do not to add nutrients directly into any body of water watering shrubs and trees be sure water is free from oil acids salts herbicides or any other substances that are toxic or harmful to vegetation water container plants thoroughly before removing from their containers to keep the plants moist and healthy during the planting process water all plants immediately after planting to water thoroughly saturate all backfill in beds during the same day of planting apply water at low pressure to avoid soil erosion and injury to roots use of water-dispersal device such as watering wand is recommended to enable efficient and even water application to all parts of the root ball make sure plants are level and the top of the root ball does not sink below existing grade once they are watered and fully settled thoroughly soak the tree root ball and adjacent prepared soil several times during the first month after planting and regularly throughout the following two summers individual watering bags are recommended especially when trees are planted in the warmer months these watering bags need to be maintained checked for leaks kept full and removed when damaged or no longer needed the use of anti-desiccant is discouraged irrigation as applicable it is not requirement to have an automated irrigation system to maintain ordinance required plantings any automated irrigation system must be installed per regulations provided under north carolina general statute 89g the city of durham regulates water usage in accordance with the code of ordinances city of durham north carolina durham city code sections and the city of durham under varying drought conditions can enact water shortage response requirements that restrict the amount and frequency of water usage in accordance with durham city code section mulching shrubs and trees all trees must be mulched to protect the roots and reduce the erosion of soil and nutrients from the planting beds the mulch should not contain any trash or weed seeds mulching must be performed within week of installation no materials mulch or otherwise shall cover the root flare of trees or large shrubs pine straw shall not be used as mulch or groundcover within ten feet of any structures consisting of exterior combustible construction and shall conform to the requirements established in chapter public safety article fire prevention and protection division fire prevention code and section use of pine straw mulch of the durham city code the use of dyed mulches and shredded pallets for mulch is not allowed shredded composted hardwood triple or double cut is preferred as mulch pine straw may be used where less formal finish is desired such as in natural areas subject to fire prevention code restrictions stone mulches may compact and decrease moisture to new plantings while reflecting heat and should be limited to unique site conditions where other mulches cannot be used the site design must provide justification for utilizing stone mulches apply mulch in one to two-inch layer within two days of planting the use of landscape fabric is not permitted mulch should not be applied closer than six inches to the trunk of tree or against the main stems of shrubs in all cases mulch should not touch the trunk of trees or main stems of shrubs after watering rake mulch to provide uniform finished surface water-wise tip mulching regulates soil temperature decreases soil water loss from the root ball and lessens weed growth weed control is important because weeds compete with trees and shrubs for moisture weed control fabric is not allowed because it can slow down water air and nutrient absorption into the root ball staking trees trees may only be staked to address specific site concerns such as high wind or slopes staking shall not be used to correct improper planting or cases where roots have been separated from the trunk the stakes shall be removed after one growing season when staking tree the ties must be loose enough to allow the tree to move and flex slightly staking for support is generally not needed for large between -inch to -inch caliper trees if the tree is planted using the methods described in this landscape manual do not stake trees less than two-inch caliper and shrubs less than eight feet in height unless they were planted as bare-root specimens or if they were planted in situations indicated below under unusual conditions such as high winds steep slopes etc staking may be desirable to stabilize the tree it is recommended that the installer discuss proposed staking with the planning site compliance inspector in these cases it is recommended to stake the trees using two minimum size wood stakes on opposing sides of the tree perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction drive anchors into undisturbed soil and never through the root ball loosely loop individual flexible straps or rope fed through sections of nylon or jute strapping around the trunk to prevent damage to the bark do not tie strapping directly onto the tree trunk the stakes should offer support but also not bind or bend the tree because flexibility of the trunk is essential for its future growth and development generally after the first growing season the tree will be able to support itself and stakes should be removed pruning techniques for trees trees shall not be pruned at the time of planting unless to remove dead diseased or significantly damaged branches trees may also be pruned to address site conflicts if less than of the total tree canopy is removed at the time of planting at no time may trees be topped as defined by the international society of arboriculture the following applies for trees that have reached the end of their warranty establishment period remove water sprouts remove crossing branches that rub against other branches the rubbing weakens the growth of both branches remove branches that grow at sharp angle to the trunk the sharp angle is weak angle of attachment and may cause weakened limb to split from the trunk or cause rot by giving water place to collect remove parallel branches those branches which attach to the trunk one above the other within inches up the trunk for street and parking lot trees prune out the lower limbs of the tree to increase the height of the crown while respecting the form of the tree and keeping within the crown to trunk ratio repeat as necessary over time to reach the required six-foot minimum clear areas in sight distance triangles or the -inches minimum recommended clear area for trees in pedestrian access areas or the -foot clear areas recommended over roadways or vehicular access areas remove any branch competing with the central leader single-stemmed trees only if left on the tree it may cause the development of two leaders and waste available growth energy later as each leader gets larger the fork may split and damage the tree remove any dead or broken branches pruning should be performed in compliance with ansi standards for tree care operations tree shrub and other plant maintenance standards practices pruning avoid improper pruning practices which are any pruning techniques which cause injury reduce health and vigor or increase risk of future failure such as the following for deciduous trees improper practices include for example topping which is the removal of the central leader or the shortening of branch ends through the application of inter-nodal cuts vista pruning which is the arbitrary removal of limbs to open the view over or under tree canopy and shearing which is the reduction of tree overall profile to pre-determined shape for deciduous shrubs the removal of more than third of healthy growth for evergreen trees and shrubs the removal of more than third of growth for all trees and shrubs the use of tools that leave uneven or broken cuts or wounds the use of climbing spikes irons or gaffs is discouraged and not permitted on city-owned trees unless the tree is being removed turf tall fescues including kentucky 31tm are not allowed for use in ordinance-required revegetation of disturbed stream buffer and floodplain areas and in areas draining into streams or wetlands due to their invasive nature under wet growing conditions see table other plants not allowed for ordinance-required planting credit seeding schedule for revegetating areas in floodplains and stream buffers disturbed during utility stormwater facility and road construction activities shall be provided on site plan landscape and utility sheets the schedule shall include at minimum the scientific and common names of the plants being installed the type of plant material seed sprigs plugs sod or other the appropriate season during which the material can be successfully applied and the rate amount per area of plant material to be planted prior to adding soil amendments installers are required to obtain soil test phosphorous and lime may not be added to turf location without soil test dictating the needed application rates see section 5j native grasses below for information about planting native grasses in lieu of tall fescues winter cover crops are often specified if the prime season for planting of permanent grasses has not arrived when turf must be planted winter rye grain not ryegrass and barley are favorable for this use at the time of turf installation fine-grade the surface relatively smooth and with maximum of one-foot vertical to three-feet horizontal difference in elevation incorporate lime and fertilizer in accordance with soil tests and the rates specified on the package in the top six to eight inches of the soil using rototiller being careful to sweep up any nutrients that land outside lawn areas on pavement or other surfaces that drain to water bodies or stormwater inlets remove all rocks larger than one-half inch in size and other debris use rake to create smooth and level bed free of hollows and depressions and soil particles no larger than pea size water to settle the soil and rake again to break the crusty surface before seeding seed can be applied with asphalt tack if not applied with asphalt tack weed-free straw or other erosion control measure should be applied to the seeded area within hours after seeding and before any heavy rains or high winds take precautions to keep vehicle and foot traffic off of seeded areas until after the first mowing best practices for sod installation spread four inches of topsoil and cultivate entire area to depth of four to six inches spread lime and fertilizer over cultivated topsoil as per specifications on package and the results of soil testing and hand rake to smooth finish grade as with seeding be careful to sweep up any lime or fertilizer landing on pavement or other surfaces that drain to water bodies or stormwater inlets to minimize pollution thoroughly water area to be sodded prior to installation lay sod roll and water thoroughly water-wise tip using warm season turf grass varieties in appropriate locations can decrease watering in the design phase avoid small areas of turf grass such as parking lot islands which have excessive water requirements and can be difficult to maintain water-wise tip water during pre-dawn hours for optimal moisture absorption and disease control but avoid over-saturation which can lead to excessive surface runoff avoid over fertilization especially in times of drought native grasses designers are encouraged to use native grasses in lieu of tall fescues or bermuda on the outside of stream buffer strips where stream buffers are disturbed for road or utility crossings and in any areas that drain to wetlands or streams establishment of native grasses requires proper timing and bed preparation often cover crop of barley or other non-invasive temporary legumes or grasses is used until the spring planting season the following native grasses can be used in place of tall fescue

faqs tree and landscaping regulations of the zoning code frequently asked questions why does the city require landscaping landscaping helps protect human health and the environment protects property values and livability and makes the urban environment more comfortable and pleasant it does so by providing shade from the sun and shelter from the wind helping to treat and manage stormwater runoff reducing noise visual and lighting impacts onsite and on neighboring properties improving the appearance and function of public and private spaces reestablishing or preserving wildlife habitat and natural areas and preserving and enhancing portland urban forest how does the zoning code require landscaping the portland zoning code requires landscaping in many situations the zoning code specifies the type of landscaping where the landscaping must be located on the site and how much area must be landscaped many different chapters of the zoning code require landscaping the four most common types of required landscaping are trees for new houses required landscaping areas on commercial sites and perimeter stormwater swale recently planted or screening landscaping such as around the edges of site and parking lot landscaping what does this manual cover the zoning code specifies the type location and area of required landscaping this manual provides additional information on the methods and materials to be used in required landscaping the manual includes plant materials planting methods irrigation maintenance and similar information in addition the manual will help you can calculate the number of trees shrubs and groundcover plants required and develop landscaping plan how do determine what landscaping is required this manual is used together with the zoning code first you must know what zoning applies to your site each zoning designation has different landscaping requirements that specify what type of landscaping is required where it must be located and how much area must be landscaped once you know the zoning designation you can find the types of landscaping required chapter describes the different types landscaping do need permit to install landscaping landscaping is usually part of larger project rather than stand-alone installation when you get building permit for the whole project it includes the landscaping permit is required in the case where required landscaping is proposed without additional development it allows the owner and the city to document that the required landscaping was installed how do get my building permit come to the city development services center at sw 4th avenue to apply for the necessary permit city staff will help you through the process tree and landscaping manual lu landscp manual what information do need to show on landscape plan in general your building permit application needs to include site plan that shows all required landscaping the information that you need to show may vary somewhat depending on what you are building and on site-specific characteristics you may include your landscaping plan on your site plan as long as all the necessary details are shown you must include the information listed below on your landscaping plan layout and dimensions and for parking lots the amount of landscaped area proposed locations and numbers of plant materials and spacing plant type both scientific and common names and size planting and tree protection details and specifications irrigation and any other elements required by the code check the individual standards that apply to your project this manual also includes worksheet to help calculate the numbers of plants needed we recommend that you use the worksheet to calculate your plant requirements and then submit it with your landscaping plan can use existing trees and plants to meet the landscaping standards yes in particular you are encouraged to preserve older larger trees wherever possible if you intend to use existing trees and plants to meet the standards you must show their locations species and sizes on your landscaping plan in addition if you are preserving trees you must have tree preservation plan what must be included in tree preservation plan tree preservation plan includes both site plan and written statement the written statement must be prepared by certified arborist and must say that the trees to be preserved are healthy the site plan must be drawn to scale and show all of the following all trees to be preserved on the site their species and diameter the location of water sewer and other utility easements the location of dry wells and soakage trenches and how the city tree protection requirements are met please see title trees how is the landscaping inspected landscaping is inspected during the erosion control permanent measures inspection which takes place at the end of project after all long-term soil stabilization measures are in place what if have to make changes to my landscaping plan after it approved it depends on how your landscaping was approved most landscaping is approved by meeting the standards in the zoning code in this case you can change the plant materials spacing and methods as long as your new proposal still meets the standards in the code changes must be approved and copy of the approved revisions to your landscaping plan must be on file with the bureau of development services sometimes landscaping is required as condition of approval of land use review such as an adjustment or conditional use and the species placement and maintenance are specified by the land use decision in this case you cannot change anything about the landscaping without going back through another land use review to modify your proposal how do use this manual first find the type of landscaping that the zoning code requires for your site once you know which standards you need to meet you can find in the manual illustrations and plain-language descriptions of them if you are looking for guidance about species of plants that may be suitable check the lists of suggested plants for required landscaping in the back of the manual the portland plant list and the stormwater management manual these lists show the size categories for many trees and give height and spacing information for shrubs and ground cover plants the manual also contains form for calculating the

or city trees protection methods the tree plan shall show that trees retained are adequately protected during construction using one of the methods described below prescriptive path root protection zone is established as follows for trees on the development site minimum of foot radius measured horizontally away from the face of the tree trunk for each inch of tree diameter see subsection measurements street trees the city forester may prescribe greater or lesser protection than required for on-site trees encroachments into the root protection zone are allowed provided the area of all encroachments is less than of the total root protection zone area and no encroachment is closer than the required radius distance see figure protection fencing consisting of minimum -foot high metal chain link construction fence secured with -foot metal posts shall be established at the edge of the root protection zone and permissible encroachment area signage designating the protection zone and penalties for violations shall be secured in prominent location on each protection fence the following is prohibited within the root protection zone of each tree or outside the limits of the development impact area ground disturbance or construction activity including vehicle or equipment access but excluding access on existing streets or driveways storage of equipment or materials

before any ground disturbing activities including clearing and grading or construction starts and shall remain in place until final inspection performance path when the prescriptive path is not practicable the applicant may propose alternative measures to modify the prescriptive root protection zone provided the following standards are met the alternative root protection zone is prepared by an arborist who has visited the site and examined the specific tree size location and extent of root cover evaluated the tree tolerance to construction impact based on its species and health and identified any past impacts that have occurred within the root zone the arborist has prepared plan providing the rationale used to demonstrate that the alternate method provides an adequate level of protection based on the findings from the site visit described above the protection zone shall be marked with signage stating that penalties will apply for violations and providing contact information for the arborist if the alternative methods require the arborist be on site during construction activity the applicant shall submit copy of the contract for those services prior to permit issuance and final report from the arborist documenting the inspections and verifying the viability of the trees prior to the city final inspection if the alternative tree protection method involves alternative construction techniques an explanation of the techniques and materials used shall be submitted the arborist shall sign the tree preservation and protection plan and include contact information maintenance		 tree and landscaping manual lu landscp manual the bds director may require the proposed tree protection method to be peer reviewed for adequacy reject the proposal if deemed insufficient to meet subsection above or require performance guarantee per section in order to ensure the protection methods are properly implemented additional information the city may request additional information regarding the proposed development including construction management approaches if the proposed development and tree protection appear to conflict the purpose of this provision is to ensure that logistical considerations are adequately addressed in order to prevent the need for changes to the tree protection measures during the construction process changes to tree protection changes to the tree protection measures during the course of the development may be approved as revision to permit provided that the change is not the result of an unauthorized encroachment into root protection zone and the applicant demonstrates that the tree protection standards of this section continue to be met when an unauthorized encroachment has occurred the city may pursue an enforcement action or other remedy per chapter tree protection inspections the city forester or bds director may conduct inspections during the course of project activity to determine compliance with this title and confirm that tree protection zones are being maintained and root protection methods are effective no person may refuse entry or access to permitted development site to any authorized

such representative while in the process of carrying out their official duties tree and landscaping manual lu landscp manual tree and landscaping manual plant materials plant materials and the suggested plant lists general portland maintains several plant lists suggested plant lists for required landscaping are part of the tree and landscaping manual and apply to landscaping required by the zoning code portland plant lists are primarily lists of plants native to portland but also include the nuisance and prohibited plant lists these lists were first developed for use in the city environmental zones street tree lists are maintained by the urban forester and apply to trees planted in the right-of way the zoning code generally does not apply to the right-of way stormwater management manual maintained by the bureau of environmental services for required landscaping you may use any plants not on the nuisance and prohibited plants listed in the portland plant list the suggested plant lists for required landscaping are intended to assist you in selecting plant materials but you do not have to limit yourself to plants on the lists if you select plants that are not on the suggested plant lists for required landscaping you must provide the bureau of development services with the necessary growth and spacing characteristics the characteristics must come from objective sources such as books manuals or cut sheets printed nursery information ground cover plants ground cover plants must be planted to fill in the area within years grasses can count as ground cover plants mulch is not substitute for ground cover plants mulch must be confined to areas underneath plants ground cover plants except turf grasses must be at least four-inch pot size when planted the ground cover plant lists include plant-spacing specifications for calculating how many plants are required shrubs shrubs must be planted to meet the height and screening requirements within years shrubs must at least the -gallon size at planting the shrub lists include spacing recommendations trees trees may be broadleaf or coniferous but must follow any plant diversity requirements broadleaf trees at the time of planting must be fully branched broadleaf trees planted must be minimum of inches in diameter conifer trees at the time of planting must be fully branched and minimum of feet in height these minimum requirements do not apply to trees used for mitigation remediation or restoration plants		 tree and landscaping manual lu landscp manual tree sizes trees are categorized as large medium or small based on their height and crown spread at maturity and on their growth rate many trees have already been categorized in the suggested plant list included as part of the landscaping manual if you want to use tree that is not already on the list give the bureau of development services bds information about the tree growth rate mature height and mature crown spread objective information may come from published sources internet web sites or from the nursery providing the tree like cut sheets you must also tell bds where you got the information trees sizes are determined according to the canopy factor which is calculated using the following formula mature height in feet mature crown spread in feet growth rate number canopy factor the growth rate number is for slow growing trees for moderately growing trees and for fast growing trees the canopy factor is greater than large trees from to medium trees less than small trees bds will update the suggested plant list from time to time to include additional trees and plants other rules existing vegetation you may use existing landscaping or natural vegetation to meet the standards if you protect and maintain it during construction as specified in zoning code section and if the plants are not listed in the nuisance plants list existing trees may be used to meet landscape requirements if they are protected and maintained during construction each existing tree up to inches in diameter counts as one small tree each existing tree or more inches in diam eter counts as medium tree for each full inch increment for example -inch tree would count as three medium trees while an -inch tree would count as one medium tree selection of materials select and locate your landscape materials to produce hardy and drought-resistant landscape area consider soil type and depth the amount of maintenance required spacing exposure to sun and wind the slope and contours of the site and compatibility with existing native vegetation preserved on the site arborescent shrubs from the portland plant list may not be used to meet the tree requirement prohibited materials plants listed as nuisance or prohibited in the portland plant lists are prohibited in required landscaped areas prohibited plants include plants identified by the director of the bureau of development services or the city forester as potentially damaging to sidewalks roads underground utilities drainage improvements foundations etc exceeding standards you may plant landscaping materials that exceed the standards so long as all fence or vegetation height limitations are met including the vision clearance standards of title vehicles and traffic complying with the standards it is the applicant responsibility to show that the landscaping materials proposed will comply with the standards plants		 tree and landscaping manual lu landscp manual tree and landscaping manual suggested plant lists suggested plant lists these are lists of suggested plants for use in required landscaping the listed species are not required and individual plants listed are not suitable for all uses successful plantings depend on planting the appropriate plant for the site and providing water and care adequate for the plants to survive and thrive no single plant is best for all situations evaluate the conditions at your site as well as the uses that will exist after you complete your development before selecting your plant materials consider the amount of light and heat if people will walk across your planted area and ways to prevent it whether the landscaping will receive runoff from roofs or pav ing the possibility that low hanging branches or dropped fruit will interfere with pedestrians or cars and so on it is your responsibility to ensure that the plants survive the most common problem is lack of water in the first one to three summers plants that die must be replaced what are the suggested plant lists for required landscaping for the suggested plant lists for required landscaping are meant to provide information about plants for general use and to make it easier for applicants to select plants they also help staff to conduct plan reviews and inspections what is the portland plant list the portland plant list is separate from the suggested plant lists for required landscaping and the tree and landscaping manual it lists plants native to portland and includes nuisance and prohibited plant lists using native plants from the portland plant list is encouraged wherever conditions are suitable do have to use native plants native plants are required only in environmental zones but they are recommended for use throughout the city native plants are suited to portland climate and soil and they require less watering fertilizer and pesticide native plants also provide habitat for native wildlife how can use the suggested plant lists first identify the characteristics of your site then select plants that match those characteristics for example if you have planter feet wide you do not want to plant tree that requires an -foot wide planter also many parking lots have lot of reflected heat in the summer so in parking lot you will probably want to use drought-tolerant plant that tolerates full sun what if want to use plant that is not on the lists you must include information about the plant size and spacing requirements when you submit your plans the information may come from commonly available reference such as the sunset western garden book or the manual of woody landscape plants by dirr from web site or from nursery wherever it comes from you must indicate the source of the information it is your responsibility to demonstrate that the zoning code planting and spacing requirements will be met you may propose to use any plant that is not on the portland nuisance and prohibited plant lists if use tree that is not on the list how do know what size it is trees are categorized by size according to the canopy factor which is calculated using the following formula mature height in feet mature crown spread in feet growth rate number canopy factor the growth rate number equals for slow growing trees for moderately growing trees and for fast growing trees the canopy factor for large trees is greater than for medium trees is from to and for small trees is less than to find out how big trees will become at maturity check printed sources or the internet how are the lists organized there are four lists the tree list the high screen shrub list the low screen shrub list and the ground cover list plant characteristics such as height spread spacing drought tolerance and so on are provided to help you select appropriate plants plants		 tree and landscaping

water efficient landscape xeriscape standards as an alternative to traditional landscaping the city encourages the use of xeriscape practices which minimize the need for watering or irrigation xeriscape principles can be summarized as follows using plants with low moisture requirements selecting plants for specific site microclimates that vary according to slope aspect soil and exposure to sun and moisture using native noninvasive adapted plant species minimizing the amount of irrigated turf planting and designing slopes to minimize storm water runoff use of separate irrigation zones adjusted to plant water requirements and use of drip or trickle irrigation systems using mulch in planted areas to control weeds cool the soil and reduce evaporation and emphasizing soil improvement

opaque from the ground to height of at least six feet with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to height of at least feet an opaque screen is intended to exclude all visual contact between uses and to create strong impression of spatial separation the opaque screen may be composed of wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis on the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation the opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than feet wide the portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in administrative guidelines prepared by the community development department l2 semi-opaque screen screen that is opaque from the ground to height of three feet with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to height of at least feet the semi opaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create strong impression of the separation of spaces the semi-opaque screen may be composed of wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation at maturity the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than feet wide the zone of intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns which will achieve this standard are included in administrative guidelines prepared by the community development department l3 broken screen screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to height of at least feet the broken screen is intended to create the impression of separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces it may be composed of wall fence landscaped earth berm planted vegetation or existing vegetation compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation the screen may contain deciduous plants suggested planting patterns which will achieve this standard are included in administrative guidelines prepared by the community development department l4 parking area landscaping landscaping that provides shade and visual relief while maintaining clear sight lines within parking areas planting areas should contain mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees shrubs and ground cover in planting islands or strips having an area of at least square feet and narrow dimension of no less than five feet suggested planting patterns which will achieve this standard are included in administrative guidelines prepared by the community development department l5 retention detention pond landscaping landscaping that provides visual relief through reduction in sight lines visible from public right-of way landscaping shall include all visible perimeter areas including side slopes and benches visible from said right-of way planting areas must be minimum of five feet in width along adjacent right-of way and may incorporate no more than percent deciduous plantings due to maintenance and pond performance constraints landscaped areas shall be on the exterior of any walls or fences provided that this requirement shall not apply to side slopes or benches within the fenced area suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in administrative guidelines prepared by the community development department the screening and landscaping requirements set forth in this section may be interpreted with some flexibility by the community development director in the enforcement of the standards it is recognized that because of the wide variety of developments and the relationships between them it is neither possible nor prudent to establish inflexible screening requirements therefore minor administrative deviations may be granted to allow less intensive screening or requirements for more intensive screening may be imposed whenever such deviations are more likely to satisfy the intent of this section ord exh 22c required landscape buffers table width of type of proposed use adjacent

bioswales rain gardens and bioswales can serve both as landscaping and stormwater management features on building site where appropriately designed and sited rain garden is shallow depressed garden that is designed and positioned on site to capture stormwater runoff and allow for the infiltration of water back into the ground rain garden plants are carefully chosen for their ability to withstand moisture extremes and potentially high concentrations of nutrients and sediments that are often found in stormwater runoff well designed and maintained rain garden serves as an attractive component of an overall landscaping plan for development site bioswale is linear vegetative stormwater runoff conveyance system that is designed to store and infiltrate water from small storm events back into the ground and direct water from heavy rain events to appropriate storm sewer inlets or other management facilities the flow of water being conveyed through bioswale is slowed down allowing for municipal storm systems to more effectively manage heavier rain events and help reduce the risk of flooding on or off-site water being infiltrated or conveyed via bioswale is also filtered by the vegetation within it generally improving both ground and surface water quality the installation of rain garden or bioswale may contribute to the overall stormwater management plan for development site and count toward meeting the city's landscaping guidelines in the same manner as that presented for perennial planting bed in figure above points for every sq ft provided that detailed plans are provided that show all proposed dimensions of the rain garden including length width depth and slope of depression location of the rain garden on the lot relative to hard-surfaced areas downspouts and site topography characteristics of the soil underlying the rain garden or bioswale description of planting media the species number and size at time of installation of all vegetation proposed for the rain garden or bioswale and information on any other materials rocks that will be used to line the raingarden or bioswale adopted revised revised page installation is not proposed for areas where there is known soil contamination unless the rain garden is proposed to be constructed with an under-drain where the characteristics of the soil would not allow for the proper infiltration of water into the ground or where there are expected high levels of foot traffic the owner can demonstrate that the rain garden or bioswale will be properly maintained kept free of trash weeds debris and dead or dying plants any pipes associated with the garden will be inspected on an annual basis and kept free of debris and by the beginning of every spring dead plant materials will be cut back or removed bioswales and rain gardens must be generously and appropriately vegetated to qualify for landscaping points bioswales and rain gardens or portions thereof that are lined with turf and or rocks but do not include other vegetation will not qualify for landscaping points to serve as component of an overall stormwater management plan for site detailed plans calculations and specifications meeting the city's stormwater management ordinance are provided detailed plans should include the location and description of all other stormwater management facilities serving the site particularly those to which any bioswale will be directed for further information on rain garden and bioswale design see rain gardem how-to manual for homeowners which is available from county uw-extension offices

maintenance for landscaping and bufferyards landscaping must be installed using landscape contracting industry standards available from landscape designers and nurseries these include proper soil conditioning removing any packing materials including wire cages burlap and string and the placement of the root collar at or slightly above grade -foot bark mulch radius around tree is ideal with the mulch no thicker than inches in general and tapered to depth of inch at the base of the tree the classic saucer shape rock mulch is discouraged around all planting areas figure suggests proper planting and maintenance techniques for deciduous trees techniques for evergreen trees and shrubs vary slightly but the basic principles are similar all landscaping must be installed prior to building occupancy or operations unless doing so would result in unsatisfactory plant survival in this case the city requires site improvement deposit until landscaping is installed according to plan all required landscaping should be continually maintained in live state to meet its original function screen plants not overly pruned maintenance must include replacement of dead or dying plants
